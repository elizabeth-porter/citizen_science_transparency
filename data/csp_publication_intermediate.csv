Conservation efforts are typically faced with scarce resources, forcing us to prioritize areas based in part on estimates of their conservation value. Two major factors in conservation value are a species uniqueness and its extinction risk. Though these ideas are multidimensional, one important component of uniqueness is evolutionary distinctness, while risk is strongly related to geographic range size. These components are combined in an assemblage-level measure called phylogenetic endemism (PE), which measures the degree to which the species in an assemblage are small-ranged and phylogenetically distinct. Broad-scale patterns and correlates of PE are becoming better known for a variety of groups, and have been shown to depend on current climate, geographic isolation and long-term climate stability. Human impacts (e.g., land cover changes), are likely to shape PE as well, though the coarse resolution of most previous studies may make this difficult to detect. Overall, PE patterns at fine spatial and temporal resolutions are not well understood. Here, we fill this gap using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. These data comprise a long-term annual record with fine spatial resolution and a near-continental extent. We assess geographic patterns and trends in PE, and relate these to a range of putative predictor variables including measures of current climate, land cover, long-term and recent climate change. Bird PE is concentrated in three main hotspots: the west coast, the southeast and south-central Canada east of the Rockies. High PE values tended to occur in regions with high temperatures and stability in temperature, both in the long (21,000 year) and short (35 year) time scales. PE patterns are driven more strongly by patterns of range size than phylogenetic distinctiveness, and are trending gradually upward, driven by increasingly frequent sightings of small-ranged species. These results indicate the importance of climate stability on multiple time scales in influencing endemism patterns and suggest a surprisingly minor influence of direct human land use. The increase in PE through time may reflect successful conservation efforts that have led to population recoveries of some small-ranged species.","[Acevedo, Sebastian; Sandel, Brody] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"Sandel, B (corresponding author), Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",bsandel@scu.edu,"Sandel, Brody/I-8009-2013",NA,Santa Clara University undergraduate research grant,Santa Clara University undergraduate research grant,SA was supported by the Santa Clara University undergraduate research grant.,NA,73,4,4,2,19,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,NA,NA,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Aerial insectivores may benefit from foraging on insects congregating at light sources. However, ALAN could negatively impact them by increasing nest visibility and predation risk, especially for ground-nesting species like nightjars (Caprimulgidae).Objectives We tested predictions based on these two alternative hypotheses, potential foraging benefits vs potential predation costs of ALAN, for two nightjar species in British Columbia: Common Nighthawks (Chordeiles minor) and Common Poorwills (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii).Methods We modeled the relationship between ALAN and relative abundance using count data from the Canadian Nightjar Survey. We distinguished territorial from extra-territorial Common Nighthawks based on their wingboom behaviour.Results We found limited support for the foraging benefit hypothesis: there was an increase in relative abundance of extra-territorial Common Nighthawks in areas with higher ALAN but only in areas with little to no urban land cover. Common Nighthawks' association with ALAN became negative in areas with 18% or more urban land cover. We found support for the nest predation hypothesis: the were strong negative associations with ALAN for both Common Poorwills and territorial Common Nighthawks.Conclusions The positive effects of ALAN on foraging nightjars may be limited to species that can forage outside their nesting territory and to non-urban areas, while the negative effects of ALAN on nesting nightjars may persist across species and landscape contexts. Reducing light pollution in breeding habitat may be important for nightjars and other bird species that nest on the ground.","[Adams, Carrie Ann; Clair, Colleen Cassady St.; Bayne, Erin M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, CW 405,Biol Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Adams, Carrie Ann] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, 1474 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Knight, Elly C.] Univ Alberta, Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, Centennial Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies CCIS 1 10, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta; Colorado State University System; Colorado State University Fort Collins; University of Alberta,"Adams, CA (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, CW 405,Biol Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",caadams1@colostate.edu,"Adams, Caroline/ABE-6358-2020; St. Clair, Colleen/A-2953-2016; Bayne, Erin/IUP-1777-2023","Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521; Knight, Elly/0000-0002-8578-892X; Adams, Carrie Ann/0000-0001-7381-0555","Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta; Environment and Climate Change Canada","Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta(University of Alberta); Environment and Climate Change Canada","We thank Birds Canada and WildResearch for supplying Canadian Nightjar Survey data, all of the volunteer citizen scientists who gathered data for the project, and Environment and Climate Change Canada for funding the Canadian Nightjar Survey.

The unprecedented number of observations generated by the recent boom in citizen science initiatives could help resolve these spatial gaps and increase the density of records in regions already covered. The study objective was to assess the value of the integrated species distribution modeling (ISDM) approach for integrating WBPHS and eBird data to model waterfowl distribution across the Canadian western boreal forest, where WBPHS data are sparse. Following the ISDM approach, we used a state-space point process formulation that combined a model for the true species distribution and two observation models for how WBPHS and eBird data were generated. Our results highlighted the importance of observational processes related to sampling effort and site accessibility for modeling eBird data. In addition, our models allowed identifying waterfowl-habitat associations related to geoclimatic, forest, and hydrological factors that explained the distribution of target species. To assess the individual contribution of WBPHS and eBird data, we re-fitted the models using only one of the two data sets and compared the results obtained against those from the integrated approach. Waterfowl-habitat associations and predictions derived from the models using both data sets and those fitted with WBPHS data only were close and consistent with the observed species distribution. However, it was more difficult to extract an ecological signal from models fitted with eBird data only. Interestingly, predictions from models combining both data sets were closer to the WBPHS records than the predictions from models fitted with WBPHS data only. By facilitating the combination of all available data sources, we demonstrated the potential of the ISDM approach for modeling and mapping species distributions. We encourage future North American waterfowl modeling attempts to use this method, especially for resolving gaps in the WBPHS coverage. As multiple data sets can be added to the original framework, integration efforts must not be restricted to the additional contribution of eBird data alone and could consider, for example, provincial atlases and regional helicopter surveys.","[Adde, Antoine; Amat, Clara Casabona, I; Mazerolle, Marc J.; Darveau, Marcel; Cumming, Steven G.] Univ Laval, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Adde, Antoine; Cumming, Steven G.] Univ Alberta, Boreal Avian Modelling Project, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [O'Hara, Robert B.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, Trondheim, Norway",Laval University; University of Alberta; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Adde, A (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.;Adde, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Boreal Avian Modelling Project, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",antoine.adde.1@ulaval.ca,"Adde, Antoine/MBH-8896-2025; O'Hara, Robert/A-7499-2008","O'Hara, Robert/0000-0001-9737-3724; Darveau, Marcel/0000-0002-0143-9272; Adde, Antoine/0000-0003-4388-0880; Mazerolle, Marc/0000-0002-0486-0310","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic Partnership Grant for Projects [NSERC STPGP 494135]; Boreal Avian Modelling Project; Institut Hydro-Quebec en environnement, developpement et societe, Laval University","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic Partnership Grant for Projects(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Boreal Avian Modelling Project; Institut Hydro-Quebec en environnement, developpement et societe, Laval University","This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic Partnership Grant for Projects (NSERC STPGP 494135) and by the Boreal Avian Modelling Project (www.borealbirds.ca).A.Adde benefited from additional scholarships from the Institut Hydro-Quebec en environnement, developpement et societe, Laval University, and the Centre d'etude de la foret.

Specifically, we explored evidence for and against the general hypotheses that scaup populations have declined in association with declining recruitment and/or female survival. We examined geographic heterogeneity in scaup demographic patterns that could yield evidence about potential limiting factors. Several biases exist in survey methodology used to estimate scaup populations and harvest statistics; however, none Of these biases likely accounted for our major findings that (1) the continental scaup breeding population has declined over the last 20 years, with widespread and consistent declines within surveyed areas of the Canadian western boreal forest where most lesser scaup breed; (2) sex ratios of lesser scaup in the U.S. harvest have increased (more males now relative to females): and (3) age ratios of lesser scaup in the U.S. harvest have declined (fewer immatures now relative to adults), especially in the midcontinent region, We interpreted these major findings as evidence that (1) recruitment of lesser scaup has declined over the last 20 years, particularly in the Canadian western boreal forest; and (2) survival of female lesser scaup has declined relative to that of males. We found little evidence that harvest was associated with the scaup population decline. Our findings underscore the need for both improvements and changes to population survey procedures and new research to discriminate among various hypotheses explaining the recent scaup population decline.","Louisiana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Louisiana Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; Ducks Unlimited Canada, Inst Wetland & Waterfowl Res, Stonewall, MB R0C 2Z0, Canada",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Afton, AD (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Louisiana Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39,99,135,0,25,WILDLIFE SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2197 USA",0022-541X,NA,NA,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Non-Canadian hunters are not sampled for composition of species harvested, so differences in proportions harvested per hunter could lead to biased harvest estimates; bias would increase with increasing proportions of unsampled non-Canadians in relation to sampled Canadian hunters. My objective was to test the assumption of equality of species composition between these 2 strata of hunters for Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba using recoveries of cackling (Branta hutchinsii), Ross's (Chen rossii), lesser snow (C. caerulescens caerulescens), and greater white-fronted (Anser albifrons) geese marked south of Queen Maud Gulf in Nunavut, Canada's Central Arctic. I used multinomial logistic regression of recoveries between Canadian and non-Canadian hunters controlling for hunting season. Non-Canadian hunters selected Ross's geese over white-fronted geese compared to Canadians hunting in both Alberta and Saskatchewan, where all 4 species are harvested. Thus, harvest estimates for Ross's geese may be biased low in Alberta and Saskatchewan and those for white-fronted geese biased high.

Investigations into the geography of synchrony can provide useful insight to inform conservation planning efforts by revealing regions of common population drivers and metapopulation extinction vulnerability. We examined the geography of spatial synchrony and decadal changes in these patterns for grassland birds in the United States and Canada, which are experiencing widespread and persistent population declines. We used Bayesian hierarchical models and over 50 years of abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to generate population indices within a 2 degrees latitude by 2 degrees longitude grid. We computed and mapped mean local spatial synchrony for each cell (mean detrended correlation of the index among neighboring cells), along with associated uncertainty, for 19 species in 2, 26-year periods, 1968-1993 and 1994-2019. Grassland birds were predicted to increase in spatial synchrony where agricultural intensification, climate change, or interactions between the 2 increased. We found no evidence of an overall increase in synchrony among grassland bird species. However, based on the geography of these changes, there was considerable spatial heterogeneity within species. Averaging across species, we identified clusters of increasing spatial synchrony in the Prairie Pothole and Shortgrass Prairie regions and a region of decreasing spatial synchrony in the eastern United States. Our approach has the potential to inform continental-scale conservation planning by adding an additional layer of relevant information to species status assessments and spatial prioritization of policy and management actions. Our work adds to a growing literature suggesting that global change may result in shifting patterns of spatial synchrony in population dynamics across taxa with broad implications for biodiversity conservation.","[Allen, Michael C.; Lockwood, Julie L.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 14 Coll Farm Rd,Floor 1, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Allen, MC (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 14 Coll Farm Rd,Floor 1, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",mcallen@scarletmail.rutgers.edu,"Allen, Michael/KEJ-6826-2024","Allen, Michael/0000-0002-6632-4337",NA,NA,NA,NA,46,5,6,4,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,NA,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Various conservation-related legislation, such as the United States Migratory Bird Treaty Act, have assisted with population recovery. The eastern population of sandhill cranes has been growing rapidly since the 1980s and is thought to have expanded its geographic range to Quebec, Canada. Understanding the colonization and habitat use by the species in previously unoccupied breeding areas is necessary to develop and apply management measures. Using a dynamic occupancy modeling approach, we investigated the recent colonization and extirpation patterns of sandhill cranes in Quebec from 2004-2019. We combined data from 3 data sets (helicopter surveys, breeding bird atlas surveys, and eBird) to increase the spatial coverage and the number of species occurrence records while accounting for imperfect detection probability. Detection probability was highest for the helicopter survey (0.70), whereas the 2 other data sets had relatively low detection levels (0.10-0.26). Based on a simulation study, we found that excluding the eBird data from the analysis produced more biased estimates than excluding the atlas and helicopter survey data sets. Throughout the study, sandhill cranes seemed to have completed their colonization of western Quebec and only recently started to nest in eastern areas. Initial occupancy increased with wetland cover and colonization probability increased weakly with the cover of agricultural areas, suggesting that in our study area sandhill cranes rely essentially on natural wetlands during the breeding season.","[Amat, Clara Casabona, I; Adde, Antoine; Darveau, Marcel] Univ Laval, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Mazerolle, Marc J.] Univ Laval, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Ctr Etud Foret, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Lepage, Christine] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Quebec City, PQ G1J 0C3, Canada",Laval University; Laval University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Amat, CCI (corresponding author), Univ Laval, 2405,Rue Terrasse,Bur 2111, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",clara.casabona-i-amat.1@ulaval.ca,"Adde, Antoine/MBH-8896-2025","Adde, Antoine/0000-0003-4388-0880; Casabona i Amat, Clara/0000-0001-8729-9217; Darveau, Marcel/0000-0002-0143-9272; Mazerolle, Marc/0000-0002-0486-0310",Mitacs; Accelerate Grant [IT12104]; Ouranos Inc.

The eastern population of sandhill cranes has been growing rapidly since the 1980s and is thought to have expanded its geographic range to Quebec, Canada. Understanding the colonization and habitat use by the species in previously unoccupied breeding areas is necessary to develop and apply management measures. Using a dynamic occupancy modeling approach, we investigated the recent colonization and extirpation patterns of sandhill cranes in Quebec from 2004-2019. We combined data from 3 data sets (helicopter surveys, breeding bird atlas surveys, and eBird) to increase the spatial coverage and the number of species occurrence records while accounting for imperfect detection probability. Detection probability was highest for the helicopter survey (0.70), whereas the 2 other data sets had relatively low detection levels (0.10-0.26). Based on a simulation study, we found that excluding the eBird data from the analysis produced more biased estimates than excluding the atlas and helicopter survey data sets. Throughout the study, sandhill cranes seemed to have completed their colonization of western Quebec and only recently started to nest in eastern areas. Initial occupancy increased with wetland cover and colonization probability increased weakly with the cover of agricultural areas, suggesting that in our study area sandhill cranes rely essentially on natural wetlands during the breeding season.","[Amat, Clara Casabona, I; Adde, Antoine; Darveau, Marcel] Univ Laval, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Mazerolle, Marc J.] Univ Laval, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Ctr Etud Foret, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Lepage, Christine] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Quebec City, PQ G1J 0C3, Canada",Laval University; Laval University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Amat, CCI (corresponding author), Univ Laval, 2405,Rue Terrasse,Bur 2111, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",clara.casabona-i-amat.1@ulaval.ca,"Adde, Antoine/MBH-8896-2025","Adde, Antoine/0000-0003-4388-0880; Casabona i Amat, Clara/0000-0001-8729-9217; Darveau, Marcel/0000-0002-0143-9272; Mazerolle, Marc/0000-0002-0486-0310",Mitacs; Accelerate Grant [IT12104]; Ouranos Inc.

Tens of thousands of birds were reported sick or dead, prompting a comprehensive assessment of mortality spanning the breeding season between April 1 and September 30, 2022. Mortality reports were collated from federal, Indigenous, provincial, and municipal agencies, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, and other nongovernmental organizations, universities, and citizen science platforms. A scenario analysis was conducted to refine mortality estimates, accounting for potential double counts from multiple sources under a range of spatial and temporal overlaps. Correcting for double counting, HPAI is estimated to have caused 40,391 wild bird mortalities in eastern Canada during the spring and summer of 2022; however, this figure underestimates total mortality as it excludes unreported deaths on land and at sea. Seabirds and sea ducks, long-lived species that are slow to recover from perturbations, accounted for 98.7% of estimated mortalities. Our study provides estimates of bird mortality, with Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus; 25,669), Common Murres (Uria aalge; 8133), and American Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima dresseri; 1894) exhibiting the highest mortality figures. We then compare these mortality estimates with recent population estimates and trends and make an initial assessment of whether biologically meaningful population-level impacts are possible. Specifically, we focus on the Northern Gannet, a species that has suffered significant global mortality, and two harvested species, Common Murre and American Common Eider, to inform management decisions. Our analysis suggests population-level impacts in eastern Canada are possible for Northern Gannets and American Common Eiders, but are unlikely for Common Murres. This study demonstrates a comprehensive approach to assessing mortality and underscores the urgent need for further research to understand the broader ecological ramifications of the HPAI outbreak on wild bird populations.","[Avery-Gomm, Stephanie; Barychka, Tatsiana; Giacinti, Jolene A.; Kusalik, Liam; Provencher, Jennifer F.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife & Landscape Sci Directorate, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [English, Matthew; Ronconi, Robert A.; Gjerdrum, Carina] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Dartmouth, NS, Canada; [Wilhelm, Sabina I.; Duffy, Steven; Ward, Christopher R.

We used two indices of loon productivity to evaluate (1) temporal patterns and (2) relationships with physical and chemical lake characteristics and human activities. Data collected from 1991 to 2000 by volunteers of the Canadian Lakes Loon Survey (CLLS) in Nova Scotia showed that loon productivity, as indexed by both the proportion of resident pairs that produced at least one large young (P(s1)) and the proportion of successful pairs that produced two large young (P(s2)), did not vary substantially from year to year and showed no linear trend from 1991 to 2000. Average estimates (1991-2000) for P(s1) and P(s2) were 0.49 +/- 0.02 and 0.43 +/- 0.03, respectively, and the mean number of chicks per residential pair over that time was 0.75 +/- 0.04. We found that human disturbance and shoreline development did not influence loon productivity during the prefledging stage on lakes surveyed by CLLS volunteers. Proportion of resident pairs rearing at least one large young was independent of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of breeding lakes, but there was a positive relationship between the proportion of successful pairs rearing two large young and DOC. Both indices of loon productivity tended to be negatively correlated with lake pH. These results were not consistent with other findings that loon productivity generally declines with lake acidity, but likely reflect the preponderance of circumneutral (pH 6.5-7.0) lakes surveyed by the CLLS volunteers in Nova Scotia.","Bird Studies Canada, Long Point Waterfowl & Wetlands Res Fund, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada",NA,"Badzinski, SS (corresponding author), Bird Studies Canada, Long Point Waterfowl & Wetlands Res Fund, POB 160, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada.",sbadzinski@bsc-eoc.org; stimmermans@bsc-eoc.org,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,56,7,7,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,NA,NA,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP,567,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,215,226,NA,10.1007/s10750-006-0043-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0043-1,NA,NA,12,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Marine & Freshwater Biology,065GK,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000239147500017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, the importance of spatial autocorrelation in distributions has been recognized. Spatial autocorrelation can be categorized as exogenous (stemming from autocorrelation in the underlying variables) or endogenous (stemming from activities of the organism itself, such as dispersal). Typically, one asks whether spatial models explain additional variability (endogenous) in comparison to a fully specified habitat model. We turned this question around and asked: can habitat models explain additional variation when spatial structure is accounted for in a fully specified spatially explicit model? The aim was to find out to what degree habitat models may be inadvertently capturing spatial structure rather than true explanatory mechanisms. Location We used data from 190 species of the North American Breeding Bird Survey covering the conterminous United States and southern Canada. Methods We built 13 different models on 190 bird species using regression trees. Our habitat-based models used climate and landcover variables as independent variables. We also used random variables and simulated ranges to validate our results. The two spatially explicit models included only geographical coordinates or a contagion term as independent variables. As another angle on the question of mechanism vs. spatial structure we pitted a model using related bird species as predictors against a model using randomly selected bird species. Results The spatially explicit models outperformed the traditional habitat models and the random predictor species outperformed the related predictor species. In addition, environmental variables produced a substantial R-2 in predicting artificial ranges. Main conclusions We conclude that many explanatory variables with suitable spatial structure can work well in species distribution models. The predictive power of environmental variables is not necessarily mechanistic, and spatial interpolation can outperform environmental explanatory variables.","McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",McGill University,"Bahn, V (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Stewart Biol Bldg,1205 Ave Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",volker.bahn@mcgill.ca; brian.mcgill@mcgill.ca,"Bahn, Volker/C-6458-2019; McGill, Brian/A-3476-2008","McGill, Brian/0000-0002-0850-1913",NA,NA,NA,NA,45,162,183,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,NA,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

This is a concern because wetlands provide essential habitat for species from a range of taxa, such as birds and anurans (frogs and toads). One wetland-dwelling species whose decline may be linked to loss of wetland wildlife habitat is the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). The decline of muskrats may also be linked to declines of other species because muskrats engage in activities that could support taxa such as birds and anurans by increasing habitat heterogeneity. We investigated whether bird and anuran species richness is related to muskrat density or if it is better predicted by land cover variables that describe the wetland and surrounding area at 30 coastal wetlands on Lake Ontario. We estimated bird and anuran species richness using data from the Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program and the Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program, and muskrat density based on muskrat house counts. Our results suggest that muskrat activity did not predict richness of anurans or birds overall; however, it did predict richness for the subset of birds that nest in emergent aquatic vegetation. Our results indicate that muskrat abundance in emergent marshes may increase habitat quality for birds that nest in emergent vegetation but may not have a measurable effect on anuran diversity in these same wetlands.","[Greenhorn, Janet E.; Sadowski, Carrie; Bowman, Jeff] Trent Univ, Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, DNA Bldg,1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9L 0G2, Canada; [Baici, Jennifer E.; Martin, Kayla D.; Newar, Sasha L.; Burgess, Thomas; Kielar, Spencer R.; Menelon, Laurelie; Melvin, Gregory P.; Persad, Rebekah; Solmundson, Kirsten; Ward, Meghan; Bowman, Jeff] Trent Univ, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9L 0G2, Canada; [Tozer, Douglas C.] Long Point Waterfowl & Wetlands Res Program, Birds Canada, 115 Front Rd, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada",Trent University; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry; Trent University,"Baici, JE (corresponding author), Trent Univ, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9L 0G2, Canada.",jenniferbaici@trentu.ca,"Solmundson, Kirsten/AAV-5000-2020; Bowman, Jeff/B-4147-2009","Burgess, Thomas/0009-0004-5558-4469; Baici, Jennifer/0000-0001-5272-7664; Persad, Rebekah/0009-0002-0567-6918",NA,NA,NA,NA,112,2,2,6,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,NA,WETLANDS,Wetlands,APR,44,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38,10.1007/s13157-024-01791-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-024-01791-x,NA,NA,14,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JZ3P6,NA,Green Submitted,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:001176944400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nest boxes, however, may provide easy access for predators and thereby create ecological traps for nesting birds. Predator exclusion techniques are often deployed at nest boxes to reduce nest predation, but few studies have tested their performance. For the first time, we test the effectiveness of predator guards in promoting the nesting success of multiple species of birds at a large spatial scale (United States and Canada). We used nest fate data from 24,114 nest records submitted from 2014 to 2016 to NestWatch, a citizen-science program focused on quantifying nesting success, to determine whether installing predator guards on nest boxes is an effective management technique. Across all species, top models predicting daily nest survival rates suggest a positive influence of predator guards, with a nearly 7% increase in nest success for attempts in boxes with guards versus attempts in boxes without guards. At the species level, nest survival was greater for individuals nesting in boxes with guards in 7 of 9 species, with no effect in the remaining 2 species. Although all types of guards were correlated with improved nesting success, birds nesting in boxes with conetype baffles, stovepipe baffles, or entrance hole extenders were most likely to result in successful nesting. Further, birds nesting in boxes with multiple predator guards were more successful, on average, than birds nesting in boxes with only a single guard. Our results can help managers of cavity-nesting birds incorporate science-based evidence into decision-making and allocate resources more effectively.

Humans have a long history of providing and managing nest boxes to support native birds; however, their management of non-native birds has received limited research attention. We surveyed people who maintain nest boxes in North America to examine the extent of interference competition for nest sites between native and non-native birds and the human behaviors intended to reduce nest site competition. Our specific objectives were to examine observations of nest usurpation of native birds by non-native birds across the United States and Canada, to ascertain whether and how people who maintain nest boxes control non-native bird species in favor of native species, and to quantify various factors correlated with the likelihood of engaging in management activities. We found that nearly one-third of the 871 respondents had observed a non-native species usurp a nest box occupied by a native species. Among respondents who reported nest usurpations, species-specific nest usurpation rates varied (range = 3-35%). We found that witnessing a nest usurpation is the most important predictor of whether or not someone will engage in management activities. Management activity was also associated with the extent to which respondents believed non-native birds to be a problem at the continental scale. Our study shows that people's observations of threats from introduced species are correlated with the environmental management actions people take, and that these actions can mitigate the threats, and potentially support the survival of native birds.","[Bailey, Robyn L.; Faulkner-Grant, Holly A.; Martin, Victoria Y.; Phillips, Tina B.; Bonter, David N.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Bailey, RL (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",rb644@cornell.edu,"Martin, Vicki/J-2131-2019; Bonter, David/H-1313-2013; Martin, Victoria/J-4634-2016","Martin, Victoria/0000-0003-3492-9240; Bailey, Robyn/0000-0002-5298-3710",Cornell Lab of Ornithology,Cornell Lab of Ornithology,Cornell Lab of Ornithology,NA,69,11,11,5,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,2578-4854,NA,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

Access to food was unrelated to the three reproductive measures for either chickadee species in our study. center dot Our results suggest that reproductive impacts of feeding birds vary by species, likely due to dietary differences. center dot Supplemental feeding during the nesting season may only be a viable conservation strategy for food-limited populations. Wild bird feeding is a popular and growing activity, with approximately half of households participating in nations including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia. Supplemental feeding can increase survival and reproductive success of birds (which is often a goal of supplemental feeding efforts), but it raises concerns about phenological mismatch and possible increased risk of nest predation. Our objectives were to test whether access to supplemental food during the breeding season was correlated with (1) advanced egg-laying phenology, (2) increased clutch size, or (3) improved nest survival of 3 cavity-nesting species (Carolina Chickadee [Poecile carolinensis], Black-capped Chickadee [P. atricapillus], and Eastern Bluebird [Sialia sialis]) at a large spatial scale (the United States and Canada; spanning 22 degrees latitude and 55 degrees longitude). We examined data from 24,528 nest attempts submitted to NestWatch from 2014 to 2019. For Eastern Bluebirds, birds with access to supplemental insects initiated clutches 5.83 +/- 0.89 (mean +/- SE) days earlier than birds without access to food subsidies, whereas predicted nest survival was 5% greater for birds with access to supplemental insects (probability of nest success = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77-0.81) than for birds without (0.74, 95% CI: 0.72-0.75). Clutch size of Eastern Bluebirds did not differ between birds with and without access to supplemental insects. For chickadees, supplemental feeding (of seeds, suet, insects, or fruit) was not correlated with phenology, clutch size, or nest survival. Our results suggest that supplemental feeding of insects can be an effective tool for increasing nest survival in Eastern Bluebirds and potentially other food-limited insectivores. However, the efficacy of supplemental feeding for improving reproductive success varies across taxa, likely related to diet. Despite widespread feeding of Black-capped and Carolina Chickadees, supplemental food had no discernable effect on timing of egg-laying, clutch size, or nest survival.","[Bailey, Robyn L.; Bonter, David N.] Cornell Univ, Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Bailey, RL (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",rb644@cornell.edu,"Bonter, David/H-1313-2013","Bonter, David/0000-0003-1768-1941; Bailey, Robyn/0000-0002-5298-3710",Cornell Lab of Ornithology,Cornell Lab of Ornithology,This research was funded by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.,NA,85,7,8,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,2732-4621,NA,ORNITHOL APPL,Ornithol.

We propose a standard for considering that landbird populations are adequately monitored: 80% power to detect a 50% decline occurring within 20 years, using a 2-tailed test and a significance level of 0.10, and incorporating effects of potential bias. Our standard also requires that at least two-thirds of the target region be covered by the monitoring program. We recommend that the standard be achieved for species' entire ranges or for any area one-third the size of the temperate portions of Canada and the United States, whichever is smaller. We applied our approach to North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. At present, potential annual bias for the BBS is estimated at +/-0.008. Further, the BBS achieves the monitoring standard for only about 42% of landbirds for which the BBS is considered the most effective monitoring approach. Achieving the proposed monitoring target for greater than or equal to80% of these species would require increasing the number of BBS-or similar survey-routes by several-fold, a goal that probably is impractical. We suggest several methods for reducing potential bias and argue that if our methods are implemented, potential bias would fall to +/-0.003. The required number of BBS or similar routes would then be 5,106, about 40% more than in the current BBS program. Most of the needed increases are in 15 states or provinces. Developing a comprehensive landbird monitoring program will require increased support for coordination of the BBS (currently 2 people) and new programs for species that are poorly covered at present. Our results provide a quantitative goal for long-term landbird monitoring and identify the sample sizes needed, within each state and province, to achieve the monitoring goal for most of the roughly 300 landbird species that are well suited to monitoring with the BBS and similar surveys.","USGS, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Snake River Field Stn, Boise, ID 83706 USA; Colorado State Univ, Colorado Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Canadian Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; US Forest Serv, Redwood Sci Lab, Arcata, CA 95521 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Colorado State University System; Colorado State University Fort Collins; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"USGS, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Snake River Field Stn, 970 Lusk St, Boise, ID 83706 USA.",jbart@eagle.boisestate.edu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31,59,71,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-541X,1937-2817,NA,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Increasingly, ornithologists are being asked to identify major sources of avian mortality so as to identify conservation priorities. Aims. Considerable evidence suggests that windows of office towers are a lethal hazard for migrating birds. The factors influencing the risk of bird-window collisions in residential settings are not understood as well. Methods. Citizen scientists were requested to participate in an online survey that asked about characteristics concerning their homes and yards, general demographic information about participants, and whether they had observed evidence of bird-window collisions at their home. Key results. We found that 39.0% of 1458 participants observed a bird-window collision in the previous year. The mean number of reported collisions was 1.7 +/- 4.6 per residence per year, with 38% of collisions resulting in a mortality. Conclusions. Collisions were not random, with the highest collision and mortality rates at rural residences, with bird feeders > rural residences without feeders > urban residences with feeders > urban residences without feeders > apartments. At urban houses, the age of neighbourhood was a significant predictor of collision rates, with newer neighbourhoods reporting fewer collisions than older neighbourhoods. Most people remembered collisions occurring in the summer months. Implications. Our results are consistent with past research, suggesting that window collisions with residential homes are an important source of mortality for birds. However, we found large variation in the frequency of collisions at different types of residences. Proper stratification of residence type is crucial to getting accurate estimates of bird-window collisions when scaling local data into larger-scale mortality estimates.","[Bayne, Erin M.; Scobie, Corey A.; Rawson-Clark, Michael] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada",University of Alberta,"Bayne, EM (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",bayne@ualberta.ca,"Bayne, Erin/IUP-1777-2023; Scobie, Corey/AAR-7125-2021","Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521",Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta; Natural Sciences and Engineering and Research Council of Canada,Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta(University of Alberta); Natural Sciences and Engineering and Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),We thank the students of the Biology 367 Class of 2009 and 2010 for all of their hard work.

Most research examining this decline is conducted in the species' native European range, but Europe encompasses a small portion of the species' current distribution. House Sparrow population trends in the United States and Canada, and the potential mechanisms driving these trends, remain relatively unexplored. We use 21 years of data from Project FeederWatch, a large-scale citizen science project, to investigate House Sparrow population trends in North America. We found winter flocks in urbanized areas were larger than flocks in rural areas, with widespread spatial heterogeneity in local population trends. Despite greater abundance in developed areas, House Sparrow populations declined in developed areas from 1995 to 2016 while remaining stable in rural areas. House Sparrow population declines coincide with an increase in populations and expansion of the winter distributions of Accipiter hawks, which are known predators of House Sparrows. However, we do not find a direct connection between the presence of Accipiter hawks at count sites and House Sparrow population declines in winter. These results expand our knowledge of widespread House Sparrow declines to North America and provide context for continuing research on House Sparrow declines in the introduced range.","[Berigan, Liam A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Greig, Emma, I; Bonter, David N.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Berigan, Liam A.] Univ Maine, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Conservat Biol, Orono, ME 04469 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Berigan, LA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Berigan, LA (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Conservat Biol, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",liam.berigan@maine.edu,"Bonter, David/H-1313-2013; Berigan, Liam/MAH-3392-2025",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,57,16,18,3,50,WILSON ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,WACO,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710 USA",1559-4491,1938-5447,NA,WILSON J ORNITHOL,Wilson J.

While it is clear that agri-cultural practices and changes in the rural landscape directly and indirectly affect bird communities, we still do not know the extent to which these impacts might change across broad spatial and temporal scales. To address this question, we combined information on agricultural activities with occurrence and abundance of 358 bird species across five time periods spanning 20 years in Canada. As a proxy for agricultural impact, we used a com-bined index that included different agricultural metrics, such as cropland and tillage area and area treated with pesticides. We found that agriculture impact was negatively associated with bird diversity and evenness across all 20 years studied, but these associations seemed to vary by region. We found good support for an overall neg-ative association between agriculture impact and bird diversity and evenness in the Eastern and Atlantic regions but weaker associations in the Prairies and Pacific. These findings suggest that agricultural activities result in bird communities that are less diverse and disproportionately benefit certain species. The spatial variation in the impact of agriculture on bird diversity and evenness we observed is likely a result of regional differences in the native vegetation, the type of crops and commodities produced, the historical context of agriculture, as well as the native bird community and the extent of their association with open habitat. Thus, our work provides support for the idea that the on-going agricultural impact on bird communities, while largely negative, is not uni-form, and can vary across broad geographic regions.","[Betini, Gustavo S.] Univ Waterloo, Sch Publ Hlth Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Malaj, Egina] Univ Saskatchewan, Toxicol Ctr, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Donkersteeg, Courtney; Wilson, Scott; Mitchell, Greg W.; Dakin, Roslyn] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Smith, Adam C.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Wilson, Scott; Bishop, Christine A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Delta, BC, Canada; [Wilson, Scott] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Mitchell, Greg W.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Clark, Robert G.; Morrissey, Christy A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Clark, Robert G.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Burns, Lynne E.; Mahony, Nancy A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Saskatchewan; Carleton University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; University of British Columbia; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; University of Saskatchewan; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada,"Betini, GS (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Publ Hlth Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",gsbetini@gmail.com,"Betini, Gustavo/C-9551-2018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,63,2,2,3,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,NA,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

However, most studies using such data assume that samples are representative of either the amount of habitat or its rate of change at larger spatial scales. We tested both of these assumptions for the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) from 1974 to 2001 in New Brunswick, Canada. Our study focused on mature forest-a cover type that we predicted would be characterized by rapid change due to human activities and that is of high ecological importance. We also sought to determine whether land cover changes adjacent to BBS routes were related to bird population trends detected in BBS data. Within all 3 time periods examined (1970s, 1980s, and 1990s), the amount of mature forest adjacent to BBS routes was significantly lower than in surrounding V blocks of latitude and longitude. This could be problematic for studies that use roadside data to compare the relative abundance of species. On average, mature forest declined at a rate of -1.5% per year over the 28-year study period. We detected no significant difference in the rate of change between degree blocks and BBS routes over this time span. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, mature forest declined more rapidly in degree blocks (-2.7%/yr) than adjacent to BBS routes (-0.5/yr). We also found that the BBS trend for a mature forest-associated species, blackburnian warbler (Dendroica fusca), was correlated with the trend in mature forest along BBS routes. This, combined with slower rates of mature forest change along routes in the 1970s and 1980s, suggests that BBS data may have underestimated population declines during this period. It is important that research be conducted to test for potential biases in roadside surveys caused by uneven rates of landscape change, particularly in regions characterized by rapid habitat alteration.","Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, Fredericton, NB E3C 2G6, Canada; Univ New Brunswick, Atlantic Cooperat Wildlife Ecol Res Network, Fredericton, NB E3B 6E1, Canada; Univ Quebec, Dept Biol, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; Univ Quebec, Ctr Etudes Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada",Oregon State University; University of New Brunswick; University of New Brunswick; University of Quebec; University of Quebec,"Betts, MG (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, 321 Richardson Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",Matthew.Betts@OregonState.edu,"Betts, Matthew/Q-2978-2019","Betts, Matthew/0000-0002-7100-2551; Bety, Joel/0000-0002-8775-6411",NA,NA,NA,NA,61,55,71,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-541X,1937-2817,NA,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Common loon reproductive success is consequently recognized as an important indicator of aquatic ecosystem health. Existing evidence points to long-term declines in productivity in portions of the common loon range; however, the reason for these declines is not well understood. Our objectives were to define underlying baseline patterns of loon reproductive success in Ontario, Canada, and to identify drivers of temporal changes in loon productivity. We analyzed 38 years of reproductive data from over 1500 lakes using data from the Canadian Lakes Loon Survey, a citizen science loon monitoring program managed by Birds Canada that has run annually in Ontario since 1981. Overall, we estimated a declining trend in common loon reproductive success of -0.10 six-week-old young per pair per year in Ontario between 1981 and 2018. We assessed the influence of 14 factors on loon reproductive success. We identified low pH and associated higher mercury as factors linked to loon productivity declines. We also demonstrated that lake area, longitude, and April temperatures can predict the number of six-week-old young per pair per year. We hypothesize that climate change-induced stress, acting through multiple interacting pathways involving mercury acidity, fish abundance, lake size, and geographic location, may account for declining loon productivity.

Paired -t- tests also indicated that the abundance of Brown Creeper Certhia americana and Downy Woodpecker Picoides pubescens was lower in affected sites following the storm. Only European Starling Sturnus vulgaris abundance increased significantly in affected sites. Species found in open habitats that forage mostly on the ground were less affected by the storm than tree foragers were. The effect of the storm on bird populations was quite significant and increased frequency of such storms could have drastic consequences on bird populations in the long term.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",Laval University,"Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",jean-pierre.savard@ec.gc.ca,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31,5,7,0,18,CANADIAN INST FORESTRY,MATTAWA,"C/O CANADIAN ECOLOGY CENTRE, PO BOX 430, 6905 HWY 17 W, MATTAWA, ONTARIO P0H 1V0, CANADA",0015-7546,1499-9315,NA,FOREST CHRON,For.

Range size was computed as the number of occupied 5.degree. latitude-longitude blocks. Three abundance measures were calculated: mean birds counted/census h across all occupied blocks, maximum birds/h in a single block and maximum birds/h on a single CBC. Range size was positively but weakly correlated with each abundance measure, and the abundance measures were very strongly correlated with one another. Geography was a powerful predictor of the species'' positions in a 2-dimensional space defined by the axes of range size and average within-range abundance. Taxa that breed and winter at higher latitudes had larger total populations and had significantly larger ranges and average local abundances. Species grouped by longitudinal areas of greatest local abundance had distinct range sizes but did not differ in average within-range abundance. Eastern species had larger ranges than comparably abundant western forms, probably because the eastern USA is characterized by relatively widespread habitat types. A species'' within-range abundance is influenced by the degree of its habitat generalization: its range size will be larger if it is a habitat generalist or a specialist on widespread habitats. Because individual CBC''s include many habitats, the same ecological attribute habitat generalization, could cause species to be both widespread and abundant inside CBC circles. Carefully standardized within-habitat censuses will be required to determine whether or not these generalist species also dominate the individual habitats occupied by their more specialized and narrowly distributed relatives.","UNIV COLORADO, DEPT ENVIRONM POPULAT & ORGAN BIOL, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23,37,39,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,1938-4254,NA,AUK,AUK,NA,101,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,266,273,NA,10.1093/auk/101.2.266,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/101.2.266,NA,NA,8,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,SU081,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:A1984SU08100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Historically, the endemic North American subspecies P. c. lathami ranged across portions of interior and northern Alaska and northwest Canada. Though often described as rare, ornithologists considered it locally common in parts of its distribution. Anecdotal reports of declines and a lack of recent observations motivated us to initiate efforts to better understand the current distribution and abundance of this species. We conducted 862 h of field surveys focused on detecting gray-headed chickadees between 2010 and 2017 and detected only three individuals and no evidence of nesting in locations where the species previously occurred. We also compiled a database of 156 occurrences that likely represents nearly all the available reliable records in North America since 1864. Based on a comparison of these data before and after the year 2000, it appears the species may no longer occur in southwestern or Interior Alaska, or the Northwest Territories where scientists previously documented it. Results from a citizen science initiative to collect recent observations revealed citizen scientists reliably report only a few gray-headed chickadee sightings annually. Additionally, the species appears to have recently disappeared from two locations where observers previously reported it annually for > 20 y. Collectively, these data suggest it is likely the species' distribution has contracted, its population has declined, and its current population size is very small in North America. We emphasize that though we base these conclusions on the best available information, more information is needed before the status of this rare species can be determined with confidence. Despite recognized limitations of the data, we failed to find any evidence contrary to our conclusions and suggest this little-studied species needs additional focused research and conservation in North America.","[Booms, Travis L.; Barger, Christopher P.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Threatened Endangered & Divers Program, 1300 Coll Rd, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [DeCicco, Lucas H.; Johnson, James A.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Migratory Bird Management, 1011 E Tudor Rd 200, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; [Barger, Christopher P.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1200 Sunnyside Ave,2041 Haworth Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",Alaska Department of Fish & Game; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; University of Kansas,"Booms, TL (corresponding author), Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Threatened Endangered & Divers Program, 1300 Coll Rd, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA.",travis.booms@alaska.gov,NA,NA,Alaska Department of Fish and Game through the federal State Wildlife Grant Program,Alaska Department of Fish and Game through the federal State Wildlife Grant Program,"We thank Trevor Haines, Steve Kendall, Tory Rhodes, and Jeff Wells for assisting with field work under challenging conditions.

On ecological time-scales, these variations in species richness should reflect rates of immigration and local extinction (extirpation). Here we ask whether the probability of local extinction in passerine birds covaries with climate. Specifically, we test whether local extinctions increase with climatic harshness or with the climatic distance from a species' optimal climate. LocationUSA and Canada. MethodsWe obtained bird counts from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) from 1967 to 2012. For each BBS route, we calculated the probability of interannual local extinction for each of 206 passerine birds. We then used linear mixed-effects models and structural equation modelling to relate local extinction rates to our hypothesized predictor variables: temperature, precipitation and their distance from the species' most occupied temperature and precipitation. ResultsWe found that local extinctions are nearly independent of temperature and precipitation: no climate is inherently more extinction-prone than any other. Similarly, the climatic distance from a species' maximally occupied temperature and precipitation has only an extremely weak positive effect on the probability of local extinction. We found that only abundance has a strong negative effect on the probability of local extinction. Main conclusionsAlthough variations in local extinctions are typically spatially structured, we conclude that they are not related to contemporary climate in a consistent way among species. Broad-scale geographical gradients of species richness are unlikely to be driven by higher extinction rates in climatically harsh areas.","[Boucher-Lalonde, Veronique; Currie, David J.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Theriault, Francois L.] McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A2, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Boucher-Lalonde, V (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",vbouc050@uottawa.ca,NA,NA,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This work was funded by a graduate scholarship to V.B.L., a summer research fellowship to F.L.T. and a discovery grant to D.J.C. from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Uncontrolled conditions, along with the relative size of target species to the more abundant background makes manual detection tedious and error-prone. In order to address these concerns, the Wildlife@Home project has been developed with a web portal to allow citizen scientists to inspect and catalog these images, which in turn provides training data for computer vision algorithms to automate the detection process. This work focuses on a project with over 65,000 Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) images from flights in the Hudson Bay area of Canada gathered in the years 2015 and 2016. This data set comprises over 3TB of raw imagery and also contains a further 2 million images from related ecological projects. Given the data scale, the person-hours that would be needed to manually inspect the data is extremely high. This work examines the efficacy of using citizen science data as inputs to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for object detection. Three CNNs were trained with expert observations, citizen scientist observations, and matched observations made by pairing citizen scientist observations of the same object and taking the intersection of the two observations. The expert, matched, and unmatched CNNs overestimated the number of lesser snow geese in the testing images by 88%, 150%, and 250%, respectively, which is less than current work using similar techniques on all visible (RGB) UAS imagery. These results show that the accuracy of the input data is more important than the quantity of the input data, as the unmatched citizen scientists observations are shown to be highly variable, but substantial in number, while the matched observations are much closer to the expert observations, though less in number. To increase the accuracy of the CNNs, it is proposed to use a feedback loop to ensure the CNN gets continually trained using extracted observations that it did poorly on during the testing phase.","[Bowley, Connor; Mattingly, Marshall, III; Desell, Travis] Univ North Dakota, Dept Comp Sci, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA; [Barnas, Andrew; Ellis-Felege, Susan] Univ North Dakota, Dept Biol, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks; University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Bowley, C (corresponding author), Univ North Dakota, Dept Comp Sci, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",connor.bowley@und.edu; marshall.p.mattingly@und.edu; andrew.barnas@und.edu; susan.felege@und.edu; tdesell@cs.und.edu,NA,"Desell, Travis/0000-0002-4082-0439",North Dakota EPSCoR; Hudson Bay Project; UND College of Arts and Sciences; National Science Foundation [1319700]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1319700] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,North Dakota EPSCoR; Hudson Bay Project; UND College of Arts and Sciences; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)NSF - Division of Information & Intelligent Systems (IIS)),"Funding was provided by North Dakota EPSCoR, the Hudson Bay Project, Central and Mississippi Flyways, and the UND College of Arts and Sciences.

Investigators visited hunters repeatedly in the field, conducting interviews and examining greater than or equal to 27% of the reported harvest. Snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) accounted for 70% of the harvest, followed by white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis, 19%), Canada geese (Branta canadensis hutchinsii, 5%), brant (Branta bernicla nigricans, 4%), tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus, 2%), and Ross' geese (Anser rossii, < 1%). Sex ratios varied by species and community. Age ratios (yearlings per adult) also varied, and were inversely correlated with the size of the previous year's continental recreational harvest for white-fronted geese. Breeding status of geese with adult plumage varied, but was generally near 80% breeders. Average annual harvests of geese and swans were estimated at 5986 for Tuktoyaktuk, 1605 for Paulatuk, and 2790 for Sachs Harbour. Regional spring harvests, as a percent of continental harvests of regional populations, were 19% for lesser snow geese and 15% for white-fronted geese. Harvest levels require consideration in all stages of management of the resource, from local to continental.

We surveyed pairs and broods to determine an index of productivity for lesser scaup Aythya affinis breeding near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. We also calculated a mallard Anas platyrhynchos productivity index for birds from northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Small mammal abundance was estimated by snap trapping rodents and by counting pellets of snowshoe hares Lepus americanus in the Yellowknife area. Because small mammal data were not available for the same area as mallard harvest survey data, correlation with an estimate of ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus harvest was used because small mammal abundance and grouse are known to correlate positively. We found a positive correlation between the abundance of rodents and lesser scaup productivity suggesting a prey switching relationship for predators between their main prey (rodents) and alternative prey (lesser scaup, eggs and ducklings). A negative correlation between snowshoe hare abundance and lesser scaup productivity was also found as well as a negative correlation between ruffed grouse abundance and mallard productivity. Negative correlations suggest a possible shared predation relationship, where changes in main prey abundance (hares) may cause a numerical response in predators that influences predation rates of shared alternative prey (ducks, eggs and ducklings). Although our conclusions are based on correlations, they indicate that a great deal of variation in boreal duck productivity might be explained by the indirect effects of coexisting prey abundance. Further work is needed to determine causal mechanisms contributing to these relationships, the effect of cycles in small mammal populations and the overall importance of top-down predator regulation for regulating duck productivity in boreal forest.","Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; Canadian Wildlife Serv, Edmonton, AB T6B 2X3, Canada; Canadian Wildlife Serv, Yellowknife, NT X1A 1E2, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada.",rod.brook@ec.gc.ca; dave.duncan@ec.gc.ca; jim.hines@ec.gc.ca; Suzanne_carriere@gov.nt.ca; bob.clark@ec.gc.ca,"Carriere, Suzanne/F-7263-2010; Clark, Robert/D-3806-2011","Duncan, David C./0009-0002-3745-114X",NA,NA,NA,NA,65,17,24,1,27,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,1903-220X,NA,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,MAR,11,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,11,NA,10.2981/0909-6396(2005)11[3:EOSMCO]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.2981/0909-6396(2005)11[3:EOSMCO]2.0.CO;2,NA,NA,9,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,910LK,NA,Bronze,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000227932700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Woodlot size was the most important variable contributing to differences in reproductive success, with local forest cover (within a 10-km radius) having no significant additional effect on productivity for any species. For all species, except Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceous), adult female reproductive success was at or above replacement levels in large fragments (mean of 121 ha core area, 849 ha woodlot area) and continuous forest, and below replacement levels in small fragments (mean of 7.8 ha core area, 93 ha woodlot area). Red-eyed Vireo productivity was particularly low, with single-brooded females unable to maintain populations in any woodlots monitored, although populations were close to replacement levels in continuous forest. Only the very largest fragments acted as sources for Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) (i.e., >23 ha in core area, 225 ha in total woodlot area). Ovenbird and Wood Thrush were the most area-sensitive, and Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludovicianus) and Veery (Catharus fuscens) the least, although all four species had significantly lower reproductive success in small as compared to large forest fragments. Reproductive success of Rose-breasted Grosbeaks and Veery were similar in large forest fragments and continuous forest and were close to maintenance levels in small fragments, despite published reports of significant declines that might be attributable to poor productivity. Nest predation was the major cause of nest failure, with brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) further reducing the number of host young fledged from Ovenbird and Red-eyed Vireo nests. Parasitism rates on the remaining species were very low and not analyzed statistically. Local forest cover had little effect on predation rate or rate of parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds. Although local forest cover had little effect on reproductive success within fragmented landscapes, nest success was significantly higher in continuous forest than in all fragments combined for both Ovenbird and Red-eyed Vireo. Our data show a poor agreement with Breeding Bird Survey population trend estimates for Ontario between 1986 and 1996. As only 1% of the forest fragments locally available are large enough to function as source habitats, we strongly advocate their preservation. We recommend preservation of forest tracts at least 500 ha in size, particularly woodlots with >90 ha in core area, to function as sources that will help guard against population declines on a local scale.","Trent Univ, Watershed Ecosyst Grad Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada",Trent University; Trent University,"Minist Nat Resources, 659 Exeter Rd, London, ON N6E 4L3, Canada.",dburke@gov.on.ca,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,55,118,164,1,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,NA,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Exploring the link between mental health and biodiversity can inform more holistic public health and urban planning. Here we examined associations between bird and tree species diversity estimates from eBird community science datasets and national forest inventories with self-rated mental health metrics from the Canadian Community Health Survey. We linked data across 36 Canadian Metropolitan Areas from 2007-2022 at a postal code level. After controlling for covariates, we found that bird and tree species diversity were significantly positively related to good self-reported mental health. Living in a postal code with bird diversity one standard deviation higher than the mean increased reporting of good mental health by 6.64%. Postal codes with tree species richness one standard deviation more than the mean increased reporting of good mental health by 5.36%. Our results suggest that supporting healthy urban ecosystems may also benefit human well-being. In neighborhoods with high bird diversity and tree species richness, residents report better mental health, according to an analysis combining population surveys, mental health indicators, bird species, and greenness data across 36 Canadian cities.","[Buxton, Rachel T.; Hudgins, Emma J.; Robichaud, Courtney; Bennett, Joseph R.] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm & Interdisciplinary Sci, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hudgins, Emma J.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Agr Food & Ecosyst Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Lavigne, Eric] Hlth Canada, Environm Hlth Sci & Res Bur, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lavigne, Eric; Prince, Stephanie A.] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Villeneuve, Paul J.] Carleton Univ, Univ, Dept Neurosci, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Prince, Stephanie A.] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Ctr Surveillance & Appl Res, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Pearson, Amber L.] Michigan State Univ, CS Mott Dept Publ Hlth, Flint, MI USA; [Halsall, Tanya] Univ Ottawa, Inst Mental Hlth Res Royal, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Carleton University; University of Melbourne; Health Canada; University of Ottawa; Carleton University; Public Health Agency of Canada; Michigan State University; University of Ottawa,"Buxton, RT (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Inst Environm & Interdisciplinary Sci, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",Rachel.buxton@carleton.ca,"Hudgins, Emma/I-1985-2019; Pearson, Amber/ABI-1631-2022; Prince, Stephanie/J-9361-2019; Lavigne, Eric/E-2948-2013","Hudgins, Emma/0000-0002-8402-5111; Prince, Stephanie/0000-0001-6729-5649; Lavigne, Eric/0000-0001-6146-9839; Pearson, Amber L./0000-0002-8848-1798","U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI); Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Social Science and Humanity Research Council, and Statistics Canada [R01CA239197]; National Institutes of Health (National Cancer Institute) [RGPIN 06147, RGPIN 04888]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI); Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Social Science and Humanity Research Council, and Statistics Canada; National Institutes of Health (National Cancer Institute)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR)","This research was conducted at the Carleton University Data Center, a part of the Canadian Research Data Center Network (CRDCN).

Deviation from optimal timing, or mismatch, can affect productivity, though birds may mediate some mismatch effects by altering their incubation behavior. We studied the consequences of nesting timing (i.e., clutch initiation relative to an index of spring start) on productivity across the breeding range of American kestrels (Falco sparverius) in the United States and southern Canada, and associations between nesting timing, incubation behavior, and hatching asynchrony. We used observations from long-term nest box monitoring, remote trail cameras, and community-scientist-based programs to obtain data on clutch initiation, productivity, incubation, and hatching synchrony. Kestrels that initiated clutches after the extended spring index (SI-x, start of spring estimate) had higher rates of nest failure and fewer nestlings than earlier nesters, and effects of nesting timing on productivity were strongest in the Northeast. In contrast, kestrels in the Southwest experienced a more gradual decline in productivity across the season. Spatial effects may be the result of regional differences in growing seasons and temporal nesting windows (duration of nesting season). Specifically, resource availability in the Northeast was highly peaked during the breeding season, potentially resulting in shorter nesting windows. Conversely, resource curves were more prolonged in the Southwest, and growing seasons are becoming longer with climate change, potentially resulting in longer nesting windows. We found an inverse relationship between nesting timing and the onset of male incubation. Males from breeding pairs that initiated clutches after SI-x began incubation sooner than males from breeding pairs that initiated clutches before SI-x. Early-onset of male incubation was positively associated with hatching asynchrony, creating increased age variation in developing young. In sum, nesting phenology relative to the SI-x has consequences for American kestrels' productivity, and these consequences vary across space. The early onset of incubation may act as a potential adaptive behavior to advance the average hatch date and spread out energetic demands. Given the effects of nesting timing on productivity, kestrels are likely to be sensitive to climate-driven advances in growing seasons and vulnerable to phenological mismatch, particularly in the Northeast.","[Callery, R.

We sampled 112 peatlands located along the Saint Lawrence River during one breeding season. We used data on, regional nesting bird assemblages from the Quebec breeding bird atlas. Peatland bird species contrasted increasingly with regional avifauna from north to south or from undisturbed to managed landscapes. Of the 17 bird species found significantly more often in peatlands than in surroundings, some preferred peatlands in the whole study area and others preferred peatlands only in particular regions. Peatland avifaunas within regions were more similar to each other than to their regional avifauna, and differences between regions probably reflected changes in peatland physiognomy. We conclude that peatlands contribute to enrich local and regional avian diversity, particularly in the lowlands of the Saint Lawrence River, where industrial pressure on peatlands is highest.

Large-scale conservation measures aimed at reducing the abundance of a wild population offer a unique opportunity to study the impacts of human exploitation on demographic parameters. We examined the effects of a spring conservation harvest and liberalized autumn/winter regulations introduced recently to control the rapid population growth of greater snow geese Anser caerulescens atlantica. 2. We predicted that these changes in regulations affected survival and recovery probabilities, as well as kill rates. This was evaluated by analysing data on geese shot by hunters before and after implementation of these measures. 3. Annual survival and recovery probabilities were estimated using likelihood-based ring recovery models, and we developed a new, flexible seasonal model to determine the specific effects of regulation changes made during different hunting seasons. We used harvest survey data to estimate ring-reporting rate, and thus to convert recovery rates into kill rates. 4. Adult recovery and kill rates increased considerably with the implementation of the new measures in 1998-99. The addition of the spring harvest in Quebec and the liberalized winter regulations in the USA had the largest impacts, whereas autumn regulation changes in Quebec apparently had little effect. Juvenile recovery and kill rates also showed a moderate increase, but were highly variable. 5. We observed a decline in mean annual adult survival rate, from 83.0% to 72.5%, although the implementation of conservation measures did not fully explain temporal variation in adult survival; juvenile survival showed no change. Adult survival was negatively related to harvest rate in adults but not in juveniles. 6. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that the spring conservation harvest led to a decrease in adult survival and an increase in hunting mortality, and probably contributed to the decline in abundance observed since its implementation. However, regulations during the traditional autumn and winter hunting seasons could also be manipulated for future population control once the spring conservation harvest is discontinued. Our approach for evaluating hunting mortality on a seasonal basis should be useful in the management of other migratory populations that move through several jurisdictions.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",Gilles.Gauthier@bio.ulaval.ca,"Gilles Gauthier, Gilles/AEK-9959-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,55,44,48,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,NA,J APPL ECOL,J.

We used band-recovery and harvest survey data from 1970 to 2001 to study temporal variations in geographic harvest distribution. and composition of GSG in Quebec, Canada and the Atlantic Flyway states (AF) in the United States. We sought to determine whether (1) geographic variation in harvest was associated with temporal trends in total harvest rates observed during this period; (2) spatiotemporal distributions of harvest varied with age and sex; and (3) harvest distribution and composition differed between the spring conservation harvest initiated in 1999 and the regular fall hunt in Quebec. We detected over time a gradual spreading in the geographic distribution of the fall harvest from the upper St. Lawrence estuary toward southwestern Quebec. During winter, a sudden northward shift in the distribution of the United States harvest in the mid-1980s was associated with a high concentration of geese in mid-Atlantic Flyway states (Maryland, Delaware, and New jersey), possibly due to short-stopping during migration. We argue that this led to a reduction of hunting pressure on GSG and may have contributed to the sudden decline in harvest rate that occurred at that time and ultimately to the ensuing population increase. We observed a decreasing proportion of juveniles in the kill throughout the hunting season within fall staging grounds in Quebec and between Quebec and the United States. We also found a much higher proportion of adults in the spring harvest than in the fall that is consistent with the conservation goal of increasing the adult harvest. We recommend that management actions focus on increasing harvest in mid-Atlantic Flyway states if further control of population growth is desired.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Canadian Wildlife Serv, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4H5, Canada",Laval University; Laval University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",gilles.gauthier@bio.ulaval.ca,"Gilles Gauthier, Gilles/AEK-9959-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,55,22,26,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-541X,1937-2817,NA,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are foundational in this effort and used to visualize the geographic range of species as the spatial representation of its realized niche. SDMs are also used to forecast range shifts under climate change, but often in the absence of empirical evidence that climate limits population growth. We explored the influence of climate on demography, seasonal migration, and the extent of the geographic range in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), a species thought to display marked local adaptation to regional climate. To do so, we developed SDMs to predict the demographic and climate niches of migratory and resident song sparrows across our study area in western North America from California to Alaska, using 48 years of demographic data from a focal population in British Columbia and 1.2 million continental-scale citizen science observations. Spatial agreement of our demographic and climate niche models in the region of our focal population was strong (76%), supporting the hypothesis that demographic performance and the occurrence of seasonal migration varied predictably with climatic conditions. In contrast, agreement at the northern (58%) and southern (40%) extents of our study area was lower, as expected if the factors limiting population growth vary regionally. Our results support the hypothesis that local climate drives spatial variation in the occurrence of seasonal migration in song sparrows by limiting the fitness of year-round residents, and suggest that climate warming has favored range expansions and facilitated an upward shift in elevational range song sparrows that forgo seasonal migration. Our work highlights the potential role of seasonal migration in climate adaptation and limits on the reliability of climate niche models not validated with demographic data.","[Carbeck, Katherine; Wang, Tongli; Arcese, Peter] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Reid, Jane M.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Reid, Jane M.] NTNU, Inst Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, Norway",University of British Columbia; University of Aberdeen; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Carbeck, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Forest Sci Ctr, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",katherinecarbeck@gmail.com,"Carbeck, Katherine/JOZ-3615-2023; Wang, Tongli/AAC-8644-2020","Carbeck, Katherine/0000-0002-6149-3668; Wang, Tongli/0000-0002-9967-6769; Arcese, Peter/0000-0002-8097-482X",Norwegian Research Council; NTNU Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics [SFF-III 223257]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of British Columbia; FRBC Chair in Conservation; Hesse Graduate Fellowship,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); NTNU Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); University of British Columbia; FRBC Chair in Conservation; Hesse Graduate Fellowship,"Norwegian Research Council and NTNU Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics, Grant/Award Number: SFF-III 223257; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of British Columbia; FRBC Chair in Conservation; Hesse Graduate Fellowship",NA,143,3,3,4,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,NA,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Using long-term avian monitoring in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada as an example, we present a methodology that uses power analysis, statistical modeling, and partial derivatives to identify cost-effective sampling strategies for ecological monitoring programs. Empirical parameter estimates were used in simulations that estimated the power of sampling designs to detect trend in a variety of species' populations and community metrics. The ability to detect trend with increased sample effort depended on the monitoring target's variability and how effort was allocated to sampling parameters. Power estimates were used to develop nonlinear models of the relationship between sample effort and power. A cost model was also developed, and partial derivatives of the power and cost models were evaluated to identify two cost-effective avian sampling strategies. For decreasing sample error, sampling multiple plots at a site is preferable to multiple within-year visits to the site, and many sites should be sampled relatively infrequently rather than sampling few sites frequently, although the importance of frequent sampling increases for variable targets. We end by stressing the need for long-term, spatially extensive data for additional taxa, and by introducing optimal design as an alternative to power analysis for the evaluation of ecological monitoring program designs.","Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",University of Alberta,"Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada.",NA,NA,"Schmiegelow, Fiona/0000-0002-8219-8684",NA,NA,NA,NA,44,37,44,2,16,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1195-5449,NA,NA,CONSERV ECOL,Conserv.

We conducted this study to support the assessment of the wildlife component of BUI 3: degradation of fish and wildlife populations. We compared bird and amphibian (frogs and toads) data from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority's Terrestrial Long-term Monitoring Program in the Toronto and Region AOC to an adjacent, but otherwise similar, reference watershed, Duffins Creek. Twelve of 13 targets were met within the AOC for forest bird, wetland bird, meadow bird and amphibian populations based on averages of mean annual values at sites within the AOC that were within two standard deviations of averages at sites in the Duffins Creek reference watershed between 2008 and 2017. Even though wildlife populations within the AOC were within the normal range of variability expected from a reference watershed, they were often at lower levels than within the Duffins Creek reference watershed. In addition, forest bird and amphibian populations were negatively affected by urbanization within the AOC and meadow bird indices declined. We conclude that while wildlife populations within the AOC currently meet targets for BUI 3, they continue to be negatively impacted by numerous stressors that are primarily related to past and ongoing urbanization. Thus, continued restoration of wildlife habitat and protection of existing habitat within the AOC is highly recommended.","[Cartwright, Lyndsay A.; Hayes, Sue; Clayton, Dan; Burns, Mary-Ann; Lewis, Dena; Gaetz, Noah; Shrestha, Namrata] Toronto & Reg Conservat Author, 5 Shoreham Dr, Downsview, ON M3N 154, Canada; [Tozer, Douglas C.] Birds Canada, POB 160 Courier 115 Front Rd, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada",NA,"Cartwright, LA (corresponding author), Toronto & Reg Conservat Author, 5 Shoreham Dr, Downsview, ON M3N 154, Canada.",lyndsay.cartwright@trca.ca,NA,"Tozer, Douglas/0000-0001-9516-876X",Environment and Climate Change Canada through the Great Lakes Sustainability Fund [GCXE16R190]; Regional Municipality of Peel; Regional Municipality of York; City of Toronto; Regional Municipality of Durham,Environment and Climate Change Canada through the Great Lakes Sustainability Fund; Regional Municipality of Peel; Regional Municipality of York; City of Toronto; Regional Municipality of Durham,"We would like to acknowledge the support provided by Environment and Climate Change Canada through the Great Lakes Sustainability Fund (Project #: GCXE16R190) for the research and analysis.

The objective of this study was to measure concentrations of metals and organochlorines in traditional foods commonly consumed by First Nations in Canada and estimate the risk from dietary exposure. Methods Data were collected from the participatory First Nations Food, Nutrition and Environment Study (2008-2018). Traditional food samples were collected by community members and concentrations of metals and organochlorines were measured. The population-weighted mean daily contaminant intake from traditional food items was estimated. Hazard quotients (HQs) were calculated by dividing contaminant intake with the toxicological reference values (TRVs). Results A total of 2061 food samples (different parts and organs) from 221 species were collected. The highest concentrations of cadmium were found in the kidneys of land mammals: moose kidney was the most significant contributor to intake. The meat of land mammals and birds had the highest lead concentrations and were the most significant contributors to intake. Arsenic was highest in seaweed, and prawn was the most significant contributor. Mercury and methyl mercury were highest in harp seal meat, with walleye/pickerel contributing most to intake. Harp seal meat also had the highest p,p'-DDE and PCB concentrations, and ooligan grease and salmon were the most significant contributors to intake. The percentage of adults eating traditional food who exceeded the TRVs was 1.9% for cadmium, 3.7% for lead, 13.6% for arsenic, 0.7% for mercury, and 0% for p,p'-DDE and PCBs. All median HQs, and most 95th percentile HQs, were less than 1. Conclusion These results can be used as a baseline of contaminant levels and exposure in traditional foods for future monitoring programs and to support risk assessment programs.","[Chan, Hing Man; Singh, Kavita; Fediuk, Karen] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Batal, Malek; Ing, Amy] Univ Montreal, Fac Med, Dept Nutr, Succ Ctr Ville, Pavillon Liliane Stewart,CP 6128, Montreal, PQ H3T 1A8, Canada; [Batal, Malek] Univ Montreal, Ctr Rech Sante Publ, 7101 Ave Parc, Montreal, PQ H3N 1X7, Canada; [Batal, Malek] CIUSS Ctr Sud Ile Montreal CReSP, 7101 Ave Parc, Montreal, PQ H3N 1X7, Canada; [Maruska, Lesya; Tikhonov, Constantine; Schwartz, Harold] Indigenous Serv Canada, Nations & Inuit Hlth Branch 1, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Sadik, Tonio] Assembly First Nations, 55 Metcalfe St,Suite 1600, Ottawa, ON K1P 6L5, Canada",University of Ottawa; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Chan, HM (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",laurie.chan@uottawa.ca,"Chan, Laurie/C-4055-2014","Batal, Malek/0000-0001-5672-0371; Chan, Laurie/0000-0003-4351-7483",First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Indigenous Services Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canada Research Chair Program,First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Indigenous Services Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canada Research Chair Program(Canada Research Chairs),The FNFNES was funded by the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Indigenous Services Canada.

Subsistence hunters may be a potential risk group for AIV infections as they frequently come into close contact with wild birds and the aquatic habitats of birds while harvesting. This study aimed to examine if knowledge and risk perception of avian influenza influenced the use of protective measures and attitudes about hunting influenza-infected birds among subsistence hunters. Methods: Using a community-based participatory research approach, a cross-sectional survey was conducted with current subsistence hunters (n = 106) residing in a remote and isolated First Nations community in northern Ontario, Canada from November 10-25, 2013. Simple descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to examine the distributions and relationships between variables. Written responses were deductively analyzed. Results: ANOVA showed that males hunted significantly more birds per year than did females (F-1,F-96 = 12.1; p = 0.001) and that those who hunted significantly more days per year did not perceive a risk of AIV infection (F-1,F-94 = 4.4; p = 0.040). Hunters engaged in bird harvesting practices that could expose them to AIVs, namely by cleaning, plucking, and gutting birds and having direct contact with water. It was reported that 18 (17.0%) hunters wore gloves and 2 (1.9%) hunters wore goggles while processing birds. The majority of hunters washed their hands (n = 105; 99.1%) and sanitized their equipment (n = 69; 65.1%) after processing birds. More than half of the participants reported being aware of avian influenza, while almost one third perceived a risk of AIV infection while harvesting birds. Participants aware of avian influenza were more likely to perceive a risk of AIV infection while harvesting birds. Our results suggest that knowledge positively influenced the use of a recommended protective measure. Regarding attitudes, the frequency of participants who would cease harvesting birds was highest if avian influenza was detected in regional birds (n = 55; 51.9%). Conclusions: Our study indicated a need for more education about avian influenza and precautionary behaviours that are culturally-appropriate. First Nations subsistence hunters should be considered an avian influenza risk group and have associated special considerations included in future influenza pandemic plans.","[Charania, Nadia A.; Martin, Ian D.; Tsuji, Leonard J.

Two marine species, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and common eider ducks (Somateria mollissima) that consume mussels, were collected by a regional community-based monitoring network established in five communities. Stable isotope tracers (carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and mercury) were measured to evaluate environmental drivers of mercury spatial patterns. Mercury concentrations of blue mussels and common eiders were twofold and fivefold higher, respectively, on the James Bay coast near the community of Chisasibi compared to sites in east Hudson Bay. Liver and muscle mercury concentrations of eiders from James Bay are among the highest values reported for the circumpolar subarctic and Arctic. Multiple lines of evidence (mercury spatial patterns, crustal elements in blue mussels, and mercury isotope values of common eiders) suggest elevated mercury in the coastal food web of east James Bay may be due to mercury loading from the La Grande River, which drains one of the largest hydroelectric developments in the world. These findings highlight the importance of further research on environmental processes linking large rivers to mercury bioaccumulation in northern coastal food webs.","[Chetelat, John; McClelland, Christine] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Heath, Joel P.] Arctic Eider Soc, Sanikiluaq, NU, Canada; [Arragutainaq, Lucassie] Sanikiluaq Hunters & Trappers Assoc, Sanikiluaq, NU, Canada; [Lameboy, John] Cree Nation Chisasibi, Chisasibi, PQ, Canada; [Mickpegak, Raymond] Sakkuq Landholding Corp, Kuujjuarapik, PQ, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada,"Chételat, J (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",john.chetelat@ec.gc.ca,"Chételat, John/AAE-4711-2020","McClelland, Christine/0000-0003-2645-0221; Chetelat, John/0000-0002-9380-7203","Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Quebec and Nunavut regions); Nunavut Department of Environment [2015-047, 2016-052, 2017-051]; Arctic Eider Society's Community-Driven Research Network from Chisasibi",Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Quebec and Nunavut regions); Nunavut Department of Environment; Arctic Eider Society's Community-Driven Research Network from Chisasibi,"This research was supported by funding from the North-ern Contaminants Program (Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, Project CB-06 and CB-08, 2013-2018) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) .

We determined how much fluctuating water levels and associated changes in emergent vegetation influence the Index of Marsh Bird Community Integrity (IMBCI) using data collected in Great Lakes coastal wetlands by participants in Bird Studies Canada's Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program. IMBCI scores for 90 wetlands in Lake Erie and 131 wetlands in Lake Ontario decreased with decreasing water levels due to decreasing number of marsh-dependent species in Lake Erie and perhaps also in Lake Ontario. The average magnitude of the decrease in scores between extremely high and low water periods for wetlands with sufficient data was 15% in Lake Erie where water dropped 0.9 m on average (n = 11 wetlands) and 18% in Lake Ontario where water dropped 0.5 m (n = 7). Scores in Lake Erie increased with increasing Typha due to increasing numbers of marsh-dependent species and decreased with increasing Phragmites due to increasing numbers of generalist species. The opposite was observed in Lake Ontario, perhaps due to denser Typha and sparser Phragmites. Scores were explained by the naturally fluctuating water levels of Lake Erie, which favored Phragmites expansion and the regulated water levels of Lake Ontario which promoted Typha expansion. Scores were influenced by fluctuating water levels and associated changes in emergent vegetation. Inter-annual water level fluctuations should be considered when interpreting any indicator of wetland health that is based on marsh-dependent bird species.

Scores from the multivariate disturbance gradient, IBI-1, and IBI-3 increased rapidly at the impaired and unimpaired ends of the impaired-to-unimpaired spectrum, whereas scores from the rank sum disturbance gradient and IBI-2 increased rapidly only at the unimpaired end. IBIs with metrics that both increased and decreased along the landscape disturbance gradient were more sensitive for identifying especially impaired and unimpaired sites (i.e., IBI-1 and IBI-3) compared to IBIs with metrics that only increased (i.e., IBI-2). Scores from all but one of the IBIs were significantly correlated with scores of at least one of the landscape disturbance gradients and scores from all three of the IBIs were significantly moderately correlated with each other (r(s) = 0.3-0.7). Site ranks arranged from impaired to unimpaired differed by 25-50 positions out of 142 possible positions depending on the pair of IBIs chosen. Much of the variation that we observed could be explained by differences among IBIs in the metrics that contributed most to impaired and unimpaired sites. Thus, we recommend the following not only for IBI users assessing the integrity of Great Lakes coastal wetlands, but also any other ecosystem where multiple landscape disturbance gradients and IBIs are available for use: (1) use multivariate instead of rank sum approaches for defining landscape disturbance gradients; (2) use IBIs with metrics that both increase and decrease along the landscape disturbance gradient instead of IBIs with metrics that only increase or only decrease; and (3) ensure that site-level species lists are reasonably complete, particularly for species that disproportionately contribute to especially impaired and unimpaired scores. Following these guidelines will increase the sensitivity and accuracy of IBIs for identifying especially impaired and unimpaired sites and ultimately result in better conservation.

We used 2010-2021 bird data from the eBird project and 2010-2019 mosquito data collected by Ontario Public Health to mimic bird and mosquito seasonal variation. We considered heterogeneous bird densities (high and low suitability areas) and homogeneous mosquito and human densities. In high suitability areas for birds, we identified 5 entry points for WNV-infected birds. We compared our simulations with pools of WNV-infected field collected mosquitoes. Simulations and sensitivity analyses were performed using MATLAB software. The results showed good correspondence between simulated and observed epidemics, supporting the validity of our model assumptions and calibration. Sensitivity analysis showed that a 5% increase or decrease in each parameter of our model except for the biting rate of bird by mosquito (coB;M)) and mosquito natural mortality rate (dM), had a very limited effect on the total number of cases (newly infected birds and humans), prevalence peak, or date of occurrence.

We used a 16-year window collision dataset for 35 migratory songbird species from Toronto's (Canada) Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP) to quantify species differences in vulnerability to urban window collision mortality and potential correlates during the autumn period by applying generalized linear models. To control for annual abundance, we used migration monitoring data from two stations. Our index of vulnerability was the catch ratio, defined as the ratio of annual catch-per-unit effort in each station's mist net program to annual catchper-unit effort in FLAP. Catch ratios varied among species with Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), and Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii) being most vulnerable to window collision mortality and Blue-headed Vireo (Vireo solitarius), Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata), and Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula) being least vulnerable. Foraging guild had a minor effect on the catch ratio, but species with a propensity for nocturnal migration had lower catch ratios (greater vulnerability) than those that did not. Based on a subset of species (n = 4) and years (n = 2), hatch-year birds were overrepresented relative to after-hatch-year birds in FLAP compared to the nearby migration monitoring station in 3 of 4 species. This study provides the first ranked list of species vulnerability to urban window collision mortality for songbirds migrating through downtown Toronto, provides evidence that juveniles are more vulnerable to window collision mortality than adults in some species, and highlights the need for more comparative studies of migratory movement behavior to investigate why some species are more vulnerable to urban window collision mortality than others.","[Colling, Olivia M.; Guglielmo, Christopher G.; Morbey, Yolanda E.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, Adv Facil Avian Res, London, ON, Canada; [Bonner, Simon J.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Morbey, YE (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",ymorbey@uwo.ca,"Morbey, Yolanda/F-9035-2013","Morbey, Yolanda/0000-0003-1719-7842",University of Western Ontario; NSERC Discovery Grants,University of Western Ontario; NSERC Discovery Grants(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We thank P.

Specifically, we first developed a suite of environmental descriptors (productivity, land cover, and elevation). These descriptors were based on readily available data, including the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and terrain data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). We then assessed the capacity of the environmental descriptors, using a decision tree approach, to estimate species richness of all breeding birds, and of groups of bird species based on habitat and nesting groupings, using data summarized from the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas. Results indicated that the variance in the distributions of total bird species richness, as well as richness of habitat and nesting groups, were well predicted by the environmental descriptors (with variance explained ranging between 47 and 75%) with the predictions clearly related to both habitat (as modeled by land cover and land cover diversity) and vegetation productivity. Modeling demonstrates that initial partitioning is most often based on land cover class, indicating that it may be the driving variable of bird species richness; however, information on vegetation productivity and energy were then critical in defining how many species occur in each habitat type. The results indicate that remotely sensed environmental descriptors can provide an effective tool for predicting breeding bird species richness at regional scales. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Problems may arise ecologically if birds arrive or depart before or after associated food resources such as plants or insects reach critical lifecycle stages. Here, I compare mean first arrival dates of the Rufous Hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus), a prolific pollinator and long-distance migrant with the northernmost breeding range of any North American hummingbird, between 1895-1969 and 2006-2015 at eight observation locations in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Historical arrivals were reported through the North American Bird Phenology Program, and recent arrivals were estimated from temporal occupancy patterns using eBird checklists. Results indicated that hummingbirds arrived 8 and 11 days later in the recent time period in two coastal cities in Oregon and 7-17 days earlier in northern, more inland cities in Washington and British Columbia. Fewer days were noted between arrivals in more northerly areas in the recent time period suggesting that birds may now be migrating faster than in the previous time period. Spring temperatures have increased in the past century in much of this region, and birds arrived earlier in years with warmer spring temperatures to suggest that migratory advances are climate-related. Later mean first arrivals reported in coastal regions of Oregon in the recent time period may suggest that Rufous Hummingbirds are bypassing coastal areas to take advantage of more predictable conditions along inland migratory routes or are shifting their breeding ranges northward, notions both supported by declining population trends observed in Breeding Bird Survey data. My results demonstrate a climate-related advancement of Rufous Hummingbirds in western North America and provide justification for the investigation of the ecological impacts of climate change on birds in coastal vs. inland environments.

Despite its obvious importance to the avifauna of the Americas, specific detail concerning the distribution and abundance of birds in the boreal forest region is largely lacking. The boreal forest is changing rapidly, as development encroaches further north in the form of logging, mining, oil and gas exploration, and human settlement. The cumulative impacts of these and other activities, against the backdrop of a changing climate, underscore the need to quantify the distribution and abundance of birds at scales that are detailed enough to inform landscape planning and management decisions. Data on relative bird abundance collected for the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas can help fill this information need.

However, due to variation among species and a shortage of analyses, changes in waterfowl migration, particularly in the fall, are not well understood. Fall migration phenology and movement patterns dictate waterfowl hunting success and satisfaction, with cascading implications on economies and support for habitat management and securement. Using 60 years of band recovery data for waterfowl banded in the Canadian Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), we evaluated whether fall migration timing and/or distribution changed in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Northern Pintail (A. acuta), and Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors) between 1960 and 2019. We found that in the Midcontinent Flyways, Mallards and Blue-winged Teal migrated faster in more recent time periods, whereas Northern Pintail began fall migration earlier. In the Pacific Flyway, Mallards began fall migration earlier. Both Mallards and Northern Pintails showed evidence of short-stopping in the Midcontinent Flyways. Indeed, the Mallard and Northern Pintail distribution of band recovery data shifted 180 and 226 km north, respectively, from 1960 to 2019. Conversely, Blue-winged Teal recovery distributions were consistent across years. Mallards and Northern Pintails also exhibited an increased proportion of band recoveries in the Pacific Flyway in recent decades. We provide clear evidence that the timing and routes of fall migration have shifted over the past 6 decades, but these phenological and spatial shifts differ among species. We suggest that using community-science data collected by hunters themselves to explain one of the group's major concerns (changes in duck abundance at traditional hunting grounds), within the environmental lens of climate change, may help lead to further engagement and two-way dialogue to support effective waterfowl management for these culturally and ecologically important species.","[Cox, Amelia R.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Yellowknife, NT, Canada; [Frei, Barbara] Environm Canada & Climate Change, Sci & Technol Branch, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gutowsky, Sarah E.] Acadia Univ, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS, Canada; [Baldwin, Frank B.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Bianchini, Kristin; Roy, Christian] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Gatineau, PQ, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Acadia University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Cox, AR (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Yellowknife, NT, Canada.;Frei, B (corresponding author), Environm Canada & Climate Change, Sci & Technol Branch, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",amelia.cox@ec.gc.ca; barbara.frei@ec.gc.ca,"Roy, Christian/LWI-1524-2024; Cox, Amelia/AAH-5701-2021","Baldwin, Frank/0000-0003-4797-5959; Frei, Barbara/0000-0003-0202-5386; Roy, Christian/0000-0002-5599-6234; Cox, Amelia/0000-0002-4804-5115; Gutowsky, Sarah E./0000-0003-1711-4744","Many thanks to the thousands of people who spent time banding waterfowl in the Canadian Prairies and to the waterfowl hunters across the continent who report bands, without whom this research would not have been possible.","Many thanks to the thousands of people who spent time banding waterfowl in the Canadian Prairies and to the waterfowl hunters across the continent who report bands, without whom this research would not have been possible.","Many thanks to the thousands of people who spent time banding waterfowl in the Canadian Prairies and to the waterfowl hunters across the continent who report bands, without whom this research would not have been possible.",NA,130,7,7,7,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,2732-4621,NA,ORNITHOL APPL,Ornithol.

We focused on the Brightsand, Saskatchewan (1979-1996) route since it once recorded the highest species richness for routes in Canada and has now dropped dramatically. We also examined other routes, Athabasca, Alberta (1972-1996), Two Hills, Alberta (1972-1996), Clouston, Saskatchewan (19731996), Tyndall, Manitoba (1971-1996), and one route located (as a control) in contiguous forest at Bird River, Manitoba (1976-1996), to determine how changes in land use influenced relative abundance and diversity of bird species, Over the 18-year history of the Brightsand route, species diversity declined from a maximum of 105 species in 1987 to 67 species in 1995. In addition, 43 species recorded regularly prior to 1990, have disappeared, and 13 other species showed significant negative population trends. This pattern was also seen in Athabasca and Tyndall, as population trends for eight species declined, as did four species on the Two Hills and Clouston routes between 1971 and 1996. Analysis of land cover data along the Brightsand BBS route indicated a 48 to 55% loss of forest cover from 1963 to 1994. Significant declines were not restricted to a particular guild of birds, as forest, grassland and wetland species all declined. In contrast, none of the species on the Bird River control route showed significant population declines. We conclude that habitat loss, due primarily to forest clearing and wetland drainage and modification for agriculture in the forest fringe region of the Canadian prairies, has contributed to the decline of species and disappearance of others on several BBS routes.",NA,NA,"Cumming, EE (corresponding author), 1542 Empress Ave, Saskatoon, SK S7K 3G3, Canada.",NA,"Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019; Van Wilgenburg, Steven/LGZ-9979-2024","Van Wilgenburg, Steven/0000-0002-6742-4567",NA,NA,NA,NA,27,13,14,1,22,OTTAWA FIELD-NATURALISTS CLUB,OTTAWA,"PO BOX 35069, WESTGATE PO, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 1A2, CANADA",0008-3550,NA,NA,CAN FIELD NAT,Can.

We outline the need for a comprehensive synthesis of existing data and for effective scientific tools to support conservation of this biome and of the birds that depend on it. To illustrate how broad collaborations can address these needs, we introduce and report on the Boreal Avian Modelling Project. This is a new partnership involving universities, government, private, and nongovernment groups that was created to develop spatially explicit, predictive models of boreal bird habitat associations across Canada. This initiative is designed to improve our understanding of the influence of environmental factors and human activities on boreal bird species, leading to spatially explicit predictive models of the distribution of avian populations. The intended applications of these models are land use planning and avian conservation across the nearctic boreal forest. In this essay, we present a description of the extensive collection of point count survey data assembled by the Project, and the library of spatial covariates used for modeling. We show how it is possible to account for a number of nuisance variables related to differences in survey protocol among source data sets and make some preliminary suggestions as to how future surveys could be standardized. We present a distance-sampling approach used to convert standardized point count data to density estimates, which we illustrate by providing habitat-specific densities and total population estimates for one species in a part of western Canada. We also illustrate the use of Classification and Regression Trees to develop species niche models from the standardized data. We conclude with a discussion of the need for a monitoring program for boreal birds in Canada, the role of predictive statistical models in developing such a program, and how monitoring could be related to boreal bird conservation through adaptive management.","[Cumming, Steven G.; Lefevre, Kara L.] Univ Laval, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Bayne, Erin] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada; [Fontaine, Trish; Schmiegelow, Fiona K.

However, recent studies present evidence that is inconsistent with each of these propositions. Here we ask: how strongly did avian species entire geographical distributions (as opposed to their latitudinal extremes) in North America track temperature changes between 1979 and 2010? Location The continental United States (excluding Alaska) and southern Canada. Methods We examined changes from 1979 to 2010 in the geographical distributions, and the realized temperature niches, of 21 species of passerine birds whose entire breeding ranges fall within the area well sampled by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We related changes in breeding distributions to the concomitant changes in breeding season temperature. Results The median temperature increased within the breeding ranges of most, but not all, species. Temperature on the coolest 2.5% of routes increased significantly for only 8 of 21 species. Most species' distributions shifted geographically, but the most frequent shift was westward, not northward. Most species' realized temperature niches changed detectably through time, mainly as a result of changing temperature (versus geographical shifts). Where shifts in geographical distribution occurred, in most cases they did not result in smaller changes in species realized temperature niche than species would have experienced by not moving at all. There is little suggestion of a lagged response to climate change. Main conclusions We find only slight evidence that the geographical distributions of North American passeriform birds, considered in their entirety (as opposed to their latitudinal extremes), tracked temperature change. Of the factors that have driven recent shifts in the geographical distributions of North American avian species temperature change is probably only a minor one.","[Currie, David J.; Venne, Simon] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Currie, David J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Ottawa; University of Queensland,"Currie, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",dcurrie@uottawa.ca,NA,"Currie, David J./0000-0002-4906-2363; Venne, Simon/0000-0003-0168-1509",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"The BBS data used in this study are the result of efforts by thousands of US and Canadian participants in the field, as well as USGS and CWS researchers and managers.

Most literature assumes that species richness should vary as a function of remaining natural area, following the well-known species-area relationship (i.e., classic SAR). However, classic SARs have consistently overestimated species losses resulting from conversion of natural forested land cover to human-dominated landscapes. Moreover, richness is sometimes a peaked function of remaining natural habitat. Recent studies propose modified SAR models based on species' utilization of multiple habitat types, yet none fully explain a peaked species-area relationship. Here, we evaluate the responses of total avian richness, forest bird richness, and open-habitat bird richness to remaining natural land cover within 991 quadrats, each 100 km(2), across southern Ontario, Canada. Total bird species richness peaks at roughly 50% natural land cover. Richness of forest birds varies as a classic power function of forested area. In contrast, richness of birds that prefer open habitats does not increase monotonically with either natural-or human-dominated land cover. Richness of open-habitat species can be predicted when we partition human-dominated land cover into an available human-dominated'' component and lost'' habitat. Distinguishing three land-cover types (natural, available human-dominated, and lost) can thus permit accurate predictions of species richness in landscapes with differing levels of natural habitat conversion.","[De Camargo, Rafael X.; Currie, David J.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"De Camargo, RX (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",rafael.x.camargo@gmail.com,"De Camargo, Rafael/F-2560-2011","De Camargo, Rafael/0000-0003-3490-9872",Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas: Bird Studies Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Federation of Ontario Naturalists; Ontario Field Ornithologists; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Ontario Graduate Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas: Bird Studies Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Federation of Ontario Naturalists; Ontario Field Ornithologists; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Ontario Graduate Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"We thank D.

Biodiversity losses will ensue. Considering patchy landscapes (e.g., different landcover types, from completely unnatural to natural systems), what should be the shape of the relationship between the total number of species as a function of the proportion of natural landcover? Current theoretical and empirical studies have insisted on monotonic increasing relationships, implying species linearly declining as natural covers are converted to human-dominated areas, ignoring non-linear unimodal ones. We addressed this issue, offering potential explanation of which factors may be linked to hump-shaped relationships between avian diversity and gradients of natural landcover in landscapes of different sizes (25-900 km(2)) in Ontario and New York State. We showed that the hump-shaped pattern is consistent across spatial scales and bioclimatic regions, where diversity reaches its maximum of around 40-60% of natural landcover. Pragmatic conservation actions aiming to mitigate biodiversity loss from land-use modifications should focus on alleviating environmental stress in intensively used areas while managing efficiently the ones holding moderate proportions of natural habitats. Abstract: Predicting species' ecological responses to landcovers within landscapes could guide conservation practices. Current modelling efforts derived from classic species-area relationships almost always predict richness monotonically increasing as the proportion of landcovers increases. Yet evidence to explain hump-shaped richness-landcover patterns is lacking. We tested predictions related to hypothesised drivers of peaked relationships between richness and proportion of natural landcover. We estimated richness from breeding bird atlases at different spatial scales (25 to 900 km(2)) in New York State and Southern Ontario. We modelled richness to gradients of natural landcover, temperature, and landcover heterogeneity. We controlled models for sampling effort and regional size of the species pool. Species richness peaks as a function of the proportion of natural landcover consistently across spatial scales and geographic regions sharing similar biogeographic characteristics. Temperature plays a role, but peaked relationships are not entirely due to climate-landcover collinearities. Heterogeneity weakly explains richness variance in the models. Increased amounts of natural landcover promote species richness to a limit in landscapes with relatively little (<30%) natural cover. Higher amounts of natural cover and a certain amount of human-modified landcovers can provide habitats for species that prefer open habitats. Much of the variation in richness among landscapes must be related to variables other than natural versus human-dominated landcovers.","[De Camargo, Rafael X.] Univ Franche Comte, Lab Chrono Environm, UMR 6249, UFC,CNRS, F-25030 Besancon, France; [De Camargo, Rafael X.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, TRANSBIO Grad Sch, COMUE UBFC, F-25000 Besancon, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Franche-Comte; Universite de Franche-Comte,"De Camargo, RX (corresponding author), Univ Franche Comte, Lab Chrono Environm, UMR 6249, UFC,CNRS, F-25030 Besancon, France.;De Camargo, RX (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, TRANSBIO Grad Sch, COMUE UBFC, F-25000 Besancon, France.",rafael.x.camargo@gmail.com,"De Camargo, Rafael/F-2560-2011","De Camargo, Rafael/0000-0003-3490-9872","I am grateful for constructive reviews two anonymous reviewers.

In this study we sought to update marsh-bird-based ecological performance indicators (PIs) that support adaptive management of long-term outflow regulation for Lake Ontario. Previous PIs established in the mid-2000 s were based on single species and monitoring them required data not currently being collected at broad scales. We therefore focused on developing and validating community-level PIs using data from an ongoing, long-term, basin-wide monitoring program, the Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program (CWMP). After identifying species with documented responses to variation in water levels in the literature, we considered a suite of potential PIs by first examining correlations with both annual mean water levels and measures of interannual water-level fluctuations. We then used a mixed-modelling framework to determine which highly correlated PIs exhibited statistically significant relationships with water-level variables. Having established significant effects of water levels on the candidate PIs, we performed a powersensitivity analysis to determine the degree of change in each PI that can be detected based on current CWMP sampling. From these analyses, we propose six potential marsh-bird based PIs: sum total abundance of sensitive marsh-obligate species, richness of sensitive marsh-obligate species, and abundance of each of red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris), common gallinule (Gallinula galeata), and least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis). Of these, the community-based PIs of sum total abundance and richness of sensitive species appear most suitable for assessing the marsh-bird community response to outflow regulation on Lake Ontario.

The resulting Portrait is an Internet site that presents the current knowledge base of the river's ecological and biological diversity ( http://lavoieverte.qc.ec.gc.ca/faune/biodiv/index.html). The Portrait provides information on over 5,000 species of flora and fauna. On the website, you will find a detailed ecological analysis of the richness, rarity and vulnerability of several broad groups of plant and animal species. Furthermore, you will find a list of species for each of the 700 survey units and a distribution map for 2,500 species recorded along the St Lawrence., in atlas form, along with a detailed conservation plan. The plan encompasses the most unique and heterogeneous landscapes of the St Lawrence, some of which have no protection at present. The Portrait provides an overview of the sites that are currently protected by public agencies and private-sector organisations and identifies new sites of interest for conserving biodiversity and protecting species at risk. This paper exposes the content of this extensive compendium on the biodiversity of the St. Lawrence. For conciseness, it presents some of the analyses conducted on birds to illustrate a few of the analytical approaches that were used. Then, the information on species richness and concentration areas for priority species of vascular plants, breeding birds and herpetofauna will serve to identify the terrestrial sites of significance for biodiversity. Finally, a similar approach having been applied to the aquatic environnement, we will conclude with a conservation plan that identifies the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and the geographic sites where the most important elements of St. Lawrence biodiversity are concentrated. Our analysis of the biodiversity of the most thoroughly studied taxa of the St. Lawrence clearly shows the importance of wetlands, particularly those located at the mouths of rivers or within archipelagos or delta complexes, such as the groups of islands and channels found at both ends of the Montreal Archipelago. These aquatic landscapes are sites of intense biological production, combining in a small geographical area spawning, nursery and feeding grounds for a large number of fish species and breeding, rearing and foraging areas for aquatic birds. Variable flooding conditions, associated with seasonal flooding or daily tidal fluctuations, create a complex mosaic of wetland and aquatic habitats. Although wetlands occupy only a small area in comparison with terrestrial habitats, they support a large number of rare plant and animal species in relation to their size. At present, 10% of the vascular flora and 27% of the herpetofauna of the St. Lawrence are at risk. In the case of reptiles and amphibians, the situation is especially worrisome because nearly all of the most threatened species live in a narrow band along the river corridor.

The resulting Portrait is an Internet site that presents the current knowledge base of the river's ecological and biological diversity ( http://lavoieverte.qc.ec.gc.ca/faune/biodiv/index.html). The Portrait provides information on over 5,000 species of flora and fauna. On the website, you will find a detailed ecological analysis of the richness, rarity and vulnerability of several broad groups of plant and animal species. Furthermore, you will find a list of species for each of the 700 survey units and a distribution map for 2,500 species recorded along the St Lawrence., in atlas form, along with a detailed conservation plan. The plan encompasses the most unique and heterogeneous landscapes of the St Lawrence, some of which have no protection at present. The Portrait provides an overview of the sites that are currently protected by public agencies and private-sector organisations and identifies new sites of interest for conserving biodiversity and protecting species at risk. This paper exposes the content of this extensive compendium on the biodiversity of the St. Lawrence. For conciseness, it presents some of the analyses conducted on birds to illustrate a few of the analytical approaches that were used. Then, the information on species richness and concentration areas for priority species of vascular plants, breeding birds and herpetofauna will serve to identify the terrestrial sites of significance for biodiversity. Finally, a similar approach having been applied to the aquatic environnement, we will conclude with a conservation plan that identifies the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and the geographic sites where the most important elements of St. Lawrence biodiversity are concentrated. Our analysis of the biodiversity of the most thoroughly studied taxa of the St. Lawrence clearly shows the importance of wetlands, particularly those located at the mouths of rivers or within archipelagos or delta complexes, such as the groups of islands and channels found at both ends of the Montreal Archipelago. These aquatic landscapes are sites of intense biological production, combining in a small geographical area spawning, nursery and feeding grounds for a large number of fish species and breeding, rearing and foraging areas for aquatic birds. Variable flooding conditions, associated with seasonal flooding or daily tidal fluctuations, create a complex mosaic of wetland and aquatic habitats. Although wetlands occupy only a small area in comparison with terrestrial habitats, they support a large number of rare plant and animal species in relation to their size. At present, 10% of the vascular flora and 27% of the herpetofauna of the St. Lawrence are at risk. In the case of reptiles and amphibians, the situation is especially worrisome because nearly all of the most threatened species live in a narrow band along the river corridor. Not only is this the sector that is under the greatest pressure from human development, very little public land remains here, making it difficult to create protected areas.

Multi-year (2000-2003) bird surveys captured bird distribution and density in wetland habitats under varying degrees of water inandation, depth and fluctuation. Analyses revealed strong associations between estimated breeding pair densities and plant communities, water depth, and degree of water level fluctuation during the breeding season for a suite of wetland bird species using marsh, wet meadow, shrub swamp and treed swamp habitats.

We determined the degree of association between the distribution of 65 breeding bird species (601 presence-absence squares of the Atlas of the Breeding Birds of Quebec) and climate variables (212 climatological stations in operation for at least 20 years over the period 1953-1984) by statistically correcting for the effects of several factors that are correlated with bird distribution. Factors considered were the nature and scale of land cover patterns that included vegetation types and landscape characterization, geographical coordinates, and elevation. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to investigate the effect of climatic variables on breeding bird distribution. Independent variables accounted for a total of 29.1% of the variation in the species matrix. A very large portion of the variance explained by climate variables was shared with spatial variables, reflecting the relationships among latitude, longitude, elevation, and climate. After correcting for the effect of land cover variables, climatic variables still explained 11.4% of the variation in the species matrix, with temperature, i.e., warmer summers and milder winters, having a greater influence than precipitation, i.e., wetter summers. Of the 65 species, 14 appeared to be particularly climate-sensitive. Eight are insectivorous neotropical migrants and six species are at the northern limit of their range in the study area. The opposite is largely true for the eight others; they are practically absent from the southern part of the study area, except for the Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), which is widespread there. The White-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis) is the only resident species that seemed responsive to climatic variables, i.e., milder winters. Climate warming is thus likely to induce northward shifts for several neotropical migrant species. Many species that currently breed in the northern portion of eastern United States are likely to move northward into Canada. It is thus crucial that sufficient habitats be preserved in Canada to accommodate these future climate refugees. Forests in the study area are under management for lumber and therefore, their conservation should receive particular attention.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS), Quebec Region; Environmental Innovation Program of Supply and Services Canada; Atmospheric Environment Service (AES); Scientific Services Division, Quebec Region; Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Basin (GLSLB) Project","Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS), Quebec Region; Environmental Innovation Program of Supply and Services Canada; Atmospheric Environment Service (AES); Scientific Services Division, Quebec Region; Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Basin (GLSLB) Project","We would like to thank the managers of the Atlas of the Breeding Birds of Quebec data bank, Jean Gauthier, Yves Aubry, and Gilles Falardeau of the Canadian Wildlife Service for giving us permission to use the data files and extract those we needed.

However, the size of landscape for which this association is maximized is generally unknown, likely to vary among species, and may affect our ability to incorporate songbirds in landscape management. We measured the occurrence and the persistence of forest songbirds in relation to the amount of habitat measured at several scales: local (100, 200 m radius), neighborhood (400, 800 m), landscape (1.6, 3.2, 6.4 km) and regional (12-24 km), based on data from Ontario's Forest Bird Monitoring Program (1987-2005). Songbird occurrence was obtained from point count sites distributed across southern Ontario and each revisited in multiple years (mean = 5.8 yr). Presence of each species at a site was associated with forest habitat area measures that account for differences in preferred forest cover types among species. Area of coniferous, deciduous and mixed forest was derived from Landsat TM imagery. Thirty-two of the 35 species studied were area-sensitive, and area-sensitivity was apparent for 13-25 species at each spatial scale. For 24 species, the strength of area-sensitivity varied with scale, suggesting the importance of local, neighborhood, landscape and regional habitat for 3, 5, 5, and 11 species respectively. As a result, the list of the five most area-sensitive species varied depending on the scale at which habitat was described. We conclude that area-sensitivity can occur at a broader set of scales than generally assumed, and is most pronounced at the regional scale. We suggest that a broad set of scales should be examined before taking conservation decisions based on avian area-sensitivity.","[Desrochers, Andre; Renaud, Christine] Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Ctr Etud Foret, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Hochachka, Wesley M.] Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Cadman, Mike] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada",Laval University; Cornell University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Desrochers, A (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Ctr Etud Foret, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",andre.desrochers@sbf.ulaval.ca,"Desrochers, André/B-6248-2008; Hochachka, Wesley/J-9768-2012","Hochachka, Wesley/0000-0002-0595-7827",NSERC of Canada,NSERC of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We want to thank all FBMP volunteers for their participation in the program, and Rich Russell and Veronique St-Louis for their help with the database.

However, some conversion of natural cover could introduce new habitat types and allow new open habitat species to occur. Moreover, decelerating richness-area relationships suggest that, as natural area is converted to human-dominated covers, more species will be added to the rare habitat than are lost from the common one. Area effects and increased habitat diversity could each lead to a peaked relationship between species richness and the relative amount of natural area. The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect on avian species richness of conversion of natural area to human-dominated land cover. Location Ontario, Canada. Methods We evaluated the responses of total avian richness, forest bird richness and open habitat bird richness to remaining natural area within 993 quadrats, each of 100 km(2). We quantified the amount of natural land cover and land-cover heterogeneity using remote sensing data. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to disentangle the relationships among avian richness, natural area and land-cover heterogeneity. Results Spatial variation in avian richness was a peaked function of remaining natural area, such that losses of up to 44% of the natural area increased avian richness. This partly reflects increased variety of land cover; however, SEM suggests that much of the increase in richness is due to pure area effects. Richness of forest species declined by two species over this range of natural cover loss while open habitat bird richness increased by approximately 20 species. The effect of natural area on species richness is consistent with the sum of species-area curves for natural habitat species and human-dominated habitat species. Main conclusions At least in northern temperate forests, almost half of the natural land cover can be converted to human-dominated forms before avian richness declines. Conversion of < 50% of regional natural area to human-dominated land cover can benefit open-area species richness with relatively few losses of forest obligate species. However, with > 50% natural area conversion, species begin to drop out of regional assemblages.","[Desrochers, Rachelle E.; Kerr, Jeremy T.; Currie, David J.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Desrochers, RE (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",rdesr104@uottawa.ca,NA,"Desrochers, Rachelle/0000-0001-5169-3853; Currie, David J./0000-0002-4906-2363","Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Bird Studies Canada, Canadian Wildlife Service, Federation of Ontario Naturalists, Ontario Field Ornithologists, and Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Ontario graduate scholarship; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation","Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Bird Studies Canada, Canadian Wildlife Service, Federation of Ontario Naturalists, Ontario Field Ornithologists, and Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ontario graduate scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario)","We are grateful to Karl Evans and three anonymous referees for very helpful comments.

Here, we test whether regional richness-environment relationships can predict local change in species richness. Location The greater park ecosystem of Thousand Islands National Park (TINP ecosystem), Ontario, Canada. Methods We evaluated change in bird richness in 85 100-km(2) sites, censused from 1981 to 1985 and from 2001 to 2005. We related change in richness over 20years to change in natural land cover for sites having initially less or greater than half natural area to determine whether richness changes in the direction predicted. We also assessed the extent to which local effects (site-level extinction and colonization based on species-specific habitat amount and neighbourhood occupancy by conspecifics) affected the predictability of species richness response to environmental change. Results Local effects predicted bird richness changes through time far better than natural area change (adjusted r(2)=0.56 vs. adjusted r(2)=0.13). Species richness did not consistently respond to change in natural area in the directions predicted by the broader spatial richness-environment relationship, tending to increase with decrease in natural area regardless of the initial amount of natural area. The observed natural area changes (+0.7km(2) to -4.4km(2)) were small relative to the changes in richness (+60 species to -37 species), likely impacting our ability to detect a response. Main conclusions The importance of local effects observed here in determining site-level species presence and consequently species richness has implications for species monitoring and the use of species richness as a measure of the avian response to land cover modification in Ontario. Detecting richness responses to environmental changes may often be challenged by low signal-to-noise' ratios and highlights the benefits of long-term species monitoring.","[Desrochers, Rachelle E.; Currie, David J.; Kerr, Jeremy T.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Desrochers, RE (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",rdesr104@uottawa.ca,NA,"Desrochers, Rachelle/0000-0001-5169-3853",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); University of Ottawa; Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Bird Studies Canada); Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Canadian Wildlife Service); Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Federation of Ontario Naturalists); Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Ontario Field Ornithologists); Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources); NSERC,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); University of Ottawa; Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Bird Studies Canada); Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Canadian Wildlife Service); Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Federation of Ontario Naturalists); Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Ontario Field Ornithologists); Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We are grateful for research support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the University of Ottawa to RED.

In the agriculture-dominated landscape of eastern Ontario and southwestern Quebec, Canada, conflicting habitat requirements exist between threatened grassland birds benefiting from certain agriculture practices, and those of a diverse woodland bird community dependent on forest recovery. Using multi-scale species distribution models with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), we assessed habitat suitability for 8 threatened grassland and forest specialists within this region. We also identified landscapes that jointly maximize occurrence of the 8 focal species and diversity of the full avian community. Influential habitat associations differed among species at the territory (200 m radius) and landscape level (1 km), highlighting the importance of considering multiple spatial scales. Species diversity was maximized when forest or grassland/pasture cover approached 40-50%, indicating a positive response to land cover heterogeneity. We identified species diversity hotspots near Lake Huron, as well as along the shore and southeast of the St. Lawrence River. These areas represent mosaic landscapes, balancing forest patches, wetland, grassland/pasture, and row crops such as corn, soybean, and cereals. Despite drastic landscape changes associated with agroecosystems, we demonstrate that targeted habitat protection and enhancement that prioritizes land cover diversity can maximize protection of bird communities with directly contrasting needs. We highlight multiple pathways to achieve this balance, including forest retention or separating row crops with hedgerows and wooded fence-lines, improving flexibility in conservation approaches.","[de Zwaan, Devin R.; Wilson, Scott] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [de Zwaan, Devin R.; Alavi, Niloofar; Mitchell, Greg W.; Duffe, Jason] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sci & Technol, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Mitchell, Greg W.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Lapen, David R.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa Res Dev Ctr, 906 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; [Wilson, Scott] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Pacific Wildlife Res Ctr, 5421 Robertson Rd, Delta, BC V4K 3N2, Canada",University of British Columbia; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Carleton University; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Pacific Wildlife Research Centre,"de Zwaan, DR (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",drdezwaan@gmail.com,"de Zwaan, Devin/L-4628-2016",NA,Interdepartmental Initiatives in the Agriculture Grant of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Interdepartmental Initiatives in the Agriculture Grant of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),"We thank all volunteers who collected the Breeding Bird Survey data, allowing us to conduct this analysis.

Under optimal migration theory, birds are expected to maximize fuel intake and minimize stopover length (the time minimization hypothesis). Within a multi-species framework, we demonstrate that time minimization behavior is context-dependent, as refueling rate, stopover length, and departure decisions vary between seasons, among species with different ecological traits (e.g., diet and migration distance), and in response to density-dependent factors and prevailing environmental conditions. Using long-term banding data (10 years) from southwestern British Columbia, Canada, we investigated the ecological processes shaping stopover dynamics among 5 warbler (Parulidae) and 5 sparrow species (Passerellidae). Specifically, we assessed variation in fuel deposition rates (FDRs) as well as the associations between mass gain, stopover length, and departure probability. FDR was greater in insectivorous warblers during spring migration and in species migrating long distances. FDR responded positively to temperature and habitat productivity, but negatively to precipitation events, particularly for insectivorous, long-distance migrants during spring migration. Similarly, density-dependent refueling rate was only observed in insectivores and long-distance migrants during spring migration, where higher densities of foliage-gleaning insectivores were associated with a lower FDR. Stopover duration was more closely associated with body condition upon arrival and subsequent mass gain than direct environmental effects, especially during northward spring migration, providing support for time minimization and a mass threshold influencing departure decisions. These results highlight that refueling rates and stopover quality vary among species depending on their life-history strategies, with particular implications for long-distance, migratory insectivores, which may be most susceptible to climate shifts.

Protected areas (PAs) may not sufficiently protect populations of species undergoing distributional shifts, necessitating that we evaluate existing PAs and identify areas for future protection to conserve biodiversity across regional and temporal scales. Coastal waterbirds are important indicators of marine ecosystem health, representing mobile, long-lived, higher trophic-level consumers. Using a 20-year citizen science dataset (1999-2019) with a before-after control-intervention sampling framework for habitat protection, we applied dynamic occupancy models to assess winter occupancy trends along the Pacific coast of Canada. Specifically, we sought to understand potential drivers of regional declines, spatial commonalities among guilds, and changes in habitat use before and after PA designation, as well as between PAs and non-PAs. Occupancy trends varied regionally, with greater declines in the south compared to the north. Regional differences underlined potential range shifts, particularly for species with traits linked to temperature tolerance, movement, and high productivity foraging, as cold-tolerant, migratory benthivores and piscivores wintered farther north relative to 20 years ago or retreated to cold-water fjords. While 21 of 57 (36.8%) species responded positively to PA designation (before-after), greater occupancy declines tended to occur in PAs established pre-1999 relative to non-PAs (control-intervention). Since PAs are currently concentrated in the south, negative associations were most apparent for species retreating northward, but existing PAs may have a stabilizing or transitory effect on southern wintering species shifting into the region from farther south. We emphasize that conservation strategies must balance persistence of current communities with preserving the climate-adapted biodiversity of tomorrow by accounting for community-level effects of species moving into and out of existing PAs. Incorporating range shifts into PA planning by predicting distributional changes will allow conservation practitioners to identify priority habitats, such as cold-water refugia, for persistent wildlife communities. Le changement climatique et les facteurs de stress anthropiques redistribuent les especes et modifient la composition des communautes a l'echelle mondiale. Les zones protegees (ZP) ne protegent peut-etre pas suffisamment les populations d'especes qui subissent des changements de repartition, ce qui nous oblige a evaluer les ZP existantes et a identifier les zones a proteger a l'avenir pour conserver la biodiversite a l'echelle regionale et temporelle. Les oiseaux cotiers sont des indicateurs importants de la sante des ecosystemes marins, car ils representent des consommateurs mobiles, ont une longue duree de vie et represente le niveau trophique superieur. En utilisant un ensemble de donnees de science participative sur 20 ans (1999-2019) avec un echantillonnage avant-apres controle-intervention (AACI) pour la protection de l'habitat, nous avons applique des modeles d'occupation dynamiques pour evaluer les tendances de l'occupation hivernale le long de la cote pacifique du Canada. Plus precisement, nous avons cherche a comprendre les moteurs potentiels des declins regionaux, les points communs spatiaux entre les guildes et les changements dans l'utilisation de l'habitat avant et apres la designation de le ZP, ainsi qu'entre les ZP et les non-ZP. Les tendances en matiere d'occupation varient d'une region a l'autre, avec des declins plus importants dans le sud que dans le nord. Les differences regionales soulignent les deplacements potentiels de l'aire de repartition, en particulier pour les especes dont les caracteristiques sont liees a la tolerance a la temperature, aux deplacements et a la recherche de nourriture a rendement eleve, car les benthivores et les piscivores migrateurs tolerants au froid ont hiverne plus au nord qu'il y a 20 ans ou se sont retires dans les fjords aux eaux froides. Alors que 21 des 57 (36,8 %) especes ont reagi positivement a la designation des aires protegees (avant-apres), les baisses d'occupation ont eu tendance a etre plus importantes dans les aires protegees creees avant 1999 que dans les aires non protegees (controle-intervention). Comme les aires protegees sont actuellement concentrees dans le sud, les associations negatives etaient plus evidentes pour les especes qui se retirent vers le nord, mais les aires protegees existantes peuvent avoir un effet stabilisateur ou transitoire sur les especes hivernant dans le sud qui se deplacent dans la region a partir d'une region plus au sud. Nous soulignons que les strategies de conservation doivent trouver un equilibre entre la persistance des communautes actuelles et la preservation de la biodiversite adaptee au climat de demain, en tenant compte des effets au niveau des communautes des especes qui entrent dans les aires protegees existantes ou qui en sortent. L'integration des changements d'aire de repartition dans la planification des aires protegees en predisant les changements de distribution permettra aux praticiens de la conservation d'identifier les habitats prioritaires, tels que les refuges d'eau froide, pour les communautes d'especes sauvages persistantes. We evaluated 20-year occupancy trends of coastal waterbirds wintering inside and outside protected areas (PAs) along Canada's Pacific coast. Occupancy declines were the greatest in older PAs concentrated at lower latitudes, with cold-tolerant, migratory benthivores and piscivores shifting farther north or to cold-water fjords. However, established PAs may have a stabilizing or transitional effect on communities as species shift into the region from farther south. Effective conservation must balance persistence of current communities with preserving future climate-adapted communities by managing for species moving into and out of existing PAs, as well as targeting future priority areas, such as cold-water refugia.image","[de Zwaan, Devin R.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB, Canada; [de Zwaan, Devin R.] Acadia Univ, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS, Canada; [Huang, Andrew] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Delta, BC, Canada; [Fox, Caroline H.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Nanaimo, BC V9R 5H7, Canada; [Bradley, David W.; Ethier, Danielle M.] Birds Canada, Port Rowan, ON, Canada",Mount Allison University; Acadia University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"de Zwaan, DR (corresponding author), Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB, Canada.",ddezwaan@mta.ca,"de Zwaan, Devin R./L-4628-2016","de Zwaan, Devin R./0000-0001-5418-0754; Bradley, David William/0000-0002-5489-6258; Ethier, Danielle/0000-0003-2191-9633","Public Conservation Assistance Fund of the Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation; Environment and Climate Change Canada (Canadian Wildlife Service); Vancouver Foundation; BC Waterfowl Society; Public Conservation Assistance Fund of the Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation, TD Friends of the Environment Fund","Public Conservation Assistance Fund of the Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation; Environment and Climate Change Canada (Canadian Wildlife Service); Vancouver Foundation; BC Waterfowl Society; Public Conservation Assistance Fund of the Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation, TD Friends of the Environment Fund","The BCCWS was conceived by a group of scientists, local naturalists, and conservation planners, initiated by Birds Canada in 1999, and sustained by >400 citizen science volunteers, without which this work would not be possible.

Human subsidies have facilitated raven dispersal into less suitable habitats and enabled these populations to maintain higher annual survival and reproduction. Concomitantly, overabundant raven populations are impacting other native at-risk species such as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and potentially the Gunnison sage-grouse (C. minimus). Using Breeding Bird Survey data from 1995-2014, we evaluated raven count data to quantitatively describe changes in abundance and expansion into sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems, specifically sage-grouse habitat. We focused our analyses on the 7 sage-grouse management zones (MZs) delineated across 11 western U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces. We assessed the effects of land cover and anthropogenic disturbance on instantaneous growth rate (r) or carrying capacity (K) of ravens. Abundance of ravens in western and southeastern MZs was greater than northeastern MZs within the greater sage-grouse range. While raven abundance was lower in MZ I and II (Alberta, Canada; Dakotas, Montana, and northwestern Colorado, USA; Saskatchewan, Canada; and Wyoming, USA), raven expansion and percent increase were equivalent or greater than all other MZs. High abundance in MZ VII indicated Gunnison sage-grouse have been exposed to increased raven populations for several decades. Areas with greater electric power transmission line density had higher r; higher K was positively related to proportion of urban land cover within 25 km and burned area within 3 km and negatively related to greater distance from landfills and proportion of forest land cover within 15 km. Ravens have capitalized on human subsidies to increase abundance and expand into sagebrush ecosystems that did not historically support high raven populations. As such, managers are now faced with a new dilemma of reducing populations of a native species to benefit other native sagebrush obligate species.","[Dinkins, Jonathan B.; Perry, Lindsey R.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Anim & Rangeland Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Beck, Jeffrey L.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Taylor, Jimmy D.] USDA, APHIS, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Oregon Field Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University; University of Wyoming; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Dinkins, JB (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Anim & Rangeland Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",jonathan.dinkins@oregonstate.edu,"Perry, Lindsey/KFA-6089-2024",NA,Anadarko Petroleum Corporation; Department of Animal and Rangeland Sciences at Oregon State University; Wyoming Wildlife and Natural Resource Trust,Anadarko Petroleum Corporation; Department of Animal and Rangeland Sciences at Oregon State University; Wyoming Wildlife and Natural Resource Trust,"Funding for our research was provided by the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Department of Animal and Rangeland Sciences at Oregon State University, and Wyoming Wildlife and Natural Resource Trust.

We then describe the degree to which projections of future species richness differ, employing both modelling approaches across multiple emissions scenarios. Location USA and Canada. Methods We use Audubon Christmas Bird Count and North American Breeding Bird Survey data to estimate current and future species richness of birds using two distinct approaches. In the first, we model richness by stacking predictions from individual species distribution models. In the second, we model richness directly, ignoring the contributions of specific taxa to richness estimates. Results The two modelling approaches show similar accuracies when validated with historical observations, particularly winter observations, and result in similar patterns of richness when projected onto current and future climate spaces. Patterns of projected change in species richness differed markedly between winter and summer seasons regardless of modelling approach. Our models suggest that bird species richness in winter will increase or remain stable across much of North America. In contrast, species richness in summer is projected to decrease over much of North America, except part of northern Canada, suggesting that climate may constrain many breeding bird species and communities in the future. Main conclusions Stacked species distribution models and macroecological models produce similar estimates of current and future species richness for each of two seasons despite being built on different concepts of community assembly. Our results suggest that, although the mechanisms that shape geographical variation in biodiversity remain uncertain, these limitations do not impede our ability to predict patterns of species richness at broad scales. Congruence of species richness projections across modelling approaches is encouraging for conservation planning efforts that focus on retaining biodiversity into the future.","[Distler, Trisha; Schuetz, Justin G.; Velasquez-Tibata, Jorge] Natl Audubon Soc, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA; [Langham, Gary M.] Natl Audubon Soc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",NA,"Distler, T (corresponding author), Natl Audubon Soc, 220 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA.",climatescience@audubon.org,NA,"Langham, Gary/0009-0002-9479-6806; Velasquez-Tibata, Jorge/0000-0002-7773-7348",US Fish and Wildlife Service through the National Landscape Conservation Cooperative Fund [F11AP00380/91200-1-9700],US Fish and Wildlife Service through the National Landscape Conservation Cooperative Fund,"This research was supported by a grant from the US Fish and Wildlife Service through the National Landscape Conservation Cooperative Fund (contract no.

We then describe the degree to which projections of future species richness differ, employing both modelling approaches across multiple emissions scenarios. Location USA and Canada. Methods We use Audubon Christmas Bird Count and North American Breeding Bird Survey data to estimate current and future species richness of birds using two distinct approaches. In the first, we model richness by stacking predictions from individual species distribution models. In the second, we model richness directly, ignoring the contributions of specific taxa to richness estimates. Results The two modelling approaches show similar accuracies when validated with historical observations, particularly winter observations, and result in similar patterns of richness when projected onto current and future climate spaces. Patterns of projected change in species richness differed markedly between winter and summer seasons regardless of modelling approach. Our models suggest that bird species richness in winter will increase or remain stable across much of North America. In contrast, species richness in summer is projected to decrease over much of North America, except part of northern Canada, suggesting that climate may constrain many breeding bird species and communities in the future. Main conclusions Stacked species distribution models and macroecological models produce similar estimates of current and future species richness for each of two seasons despite being built on different concepts of community assembly. Our results suggest that, although the mechanisms that shape geographical variation in biodiversity remain uncertain, these limitations do not impede our ability to predict patterns of species richness at broad scales. Congruence of species richness projections across modelling approaches is encouraging for conservation planning efforts that focus on retaining biodiversity into the future.","[Distler, Trisha; Schuetz, Justin G.; Velasquez-Tibata, Jorge] Natl Audubon Soc, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA; [Langham, Gary M.] Natl Audubon Soc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",NA,"Distler, T (corresponding author), Natl Audubon Soc, 220 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA.",climatescience@audubon.org,NA,"Langham, Gary/0009-0002-9479-6806; Velasquez-Tibata, Jorge/0000-0002-7773-7348",US Fish and Wildlife Service through the National Landscape Conservation Cooperative Fund [F11AP00380/91200-1-9700],US Fish and Wildlife Service through the National Landscape Conservation Cooperative Fund,"This research was supported by a grant from the US Fish and Wildlife Service through the National Landscape Conservation Cooperative Fund (contract no.

An examination of correlations between measures of bird and insect abundance across different spatial scales and over varying time lag effects may provide insight into underlying mechanisms. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to assess correlations between counts of eight warbler species from the Breeding Bird Survey in eastern Canada, 1966 to 2009, with the presence of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) at immediate local scales and time-lagged regional scales, as measured by extent of defoliation on host tree species. Budworm-associated species Cape May warbler (Setophaga tigrina), bay-breasted warbler (Setophaga castanea), and Tennessee warbler (Oreothlypis peregrina) responded strongly and positively to both local and regional effects. In contrast, non-budworm-associated species, Blackburnian warbler (Setophaga fusca), magnolia warbler (Setophaga magnolia), Canada warbler (Cardellina canadensis), black-throated blue warbler (Setophaga caerulescens), and black-throated green warbler (Setophaga virens), only responded to regional effects in a manner that varied across eastern Canada. The complex responses by forest birds to insect outbreaks involve both increased numerical responses to food supply and to longer term responses to changes in forest structure and composition. These effects can vary across spatial scales and be captured in hierarchical population models, which can serve to disentangle common trends from data when examining drivers of population dynamics like forest management or climate change.","[Drever, Mark C.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, 5421 Robertson Rd, Delta, BC V4K 3N2, Canada; [Smith, Adam C.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Venier, Lisa A.] Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Great Lakes Forestry Ctr, Marie, ON, Canada; [Sleep, Darren J.

All individuals were severely underweight and showing signs of physiological stress. The guts of all carcasses contained ingested plastics (100%, n = 9). Distribution modelling from pelagic bird surveys (1990-2010) indicated that Red Phalaropes are not typically found in the study area during fall months. Ocean conditions during fall 2016 were unusually warm, coinciding with reduced upwelling in the study area. eBird records since 1980 indicated Red Phalaropes are observed closer to shore during periods associated with reduced upwelling. These results suggest that distribution shifts of Red Phalaropes closer to shore, where plastic debris occurs in higher concentrations, may lead phalaropes to feed on plastic debris while in a weakened state, resulting in a combination of two adverse circumstances.","[Drever, Mark C.; Wilson, Laurie] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Delta, BC, Canada; [Provencher, Jennifer F.] Acadia Univ, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS, Canada; [O'Hara, Patrick D.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Inst Ocean Sci, Sidney, BC, Canada; [Bowes, Victoria] Minist Agr, Ctr Anim Hlth, Abbotsford, BC, Canada; [Bergman, Carita M.] Natl Marine Conservat Area Reserve & Haida Herita, Gwaii Haanas Natl Pk Reserve, Skidegate, BC, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Acadia University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Drever, MC (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Delta, BC, Canada.",mark.drever@canada.ca,"Provencher, Jennifer/J-2839-2016","Drever, Mark/0000-0001-5303-9230",Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Parks Canada; British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture; Garfield Weston Fellowship in Northern Research,Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Parks Canada; British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture; Garfield Weston Fellowship in Northern Research,"This work was supported by the Canadian Wildlife Service, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Parks Canada, and the British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture.

Population trends for 1979-91 were calculated for 13 songbird species captured during autumn mist netting at 2 sites in southern Michigan. AII species were northern-nesters occurring at the study sites only as transients. Annual indices of abundance were derived from a multiple regression of daily number of newly-captured birds on independent variables for date, weather, moon phase and year.

Checklist programs can be improved for population monitoring purposes by encouraging frequent reporting front standard sites, and by collecting recommended ancillary data that allow analysts to select data most appropriate to their research questions.","Canadian Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; Etud Populat Oiseaux Quebec, Rimouski, PQ G5L 4R5, Canada; Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; University of Sherbrooke,"Dunn, EH (corresponding author), Canadian Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, 100 Gamelin Blvd, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,4,4,1,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0273-8570,NA,NA,J FIELD ORNITHOL,J.

Dunn 2002,Using decline in bird populations to identify needs for conservation action,2002,2.663,1,BBS,BBS,none,none,0,J,"Dunn, EH",NA,NA,NA,"Dunn, EH",NA,NA,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRENDS,"A large decline in population size is sometimes considered sufficient indication that a species merits conservation interest. One organization categorizes as critically endangered any species whose populations decline by 80% over 10 years, whereas others assign importance to species declining 50% over 25 years. Using these and additional conservation-alert categories, I determined how many of over 200 bird species that breed in Canada qualified for each category, based on population trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The majority of qualifying species were not candidates for immediate intervention to halt or reverse declines. Moreover, species assigned to alert categories based on 5- and 10-year trends for past time periods frequently had positive trends in the subsequent decade. Results indicate that population decline should not be used to identify species at risk or as a basis for conservation action without detailed evaluation of the trend data and other characteristics of the species. However, assigning species to alert categories is a useful step in identifying species that may deserve conservation attention of some kind ( including better monitoring and research as well as direct intervention). Evaluation of trend quality and persistence is an important step in determining the most appropriate action. Deciding when to recommend intervention will be the most problematic for species that are still relatively common and widespread, and there is a need for development of species-specific population thresholds that would be appropriate for triggering such action.","Canadian Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada,"Dunn, EH (corresponding author), Canadian Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, 100 Gamelin Blvd, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19,45,56,0,22,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0888-8892,NA,NA,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Mean delta D varied among stations and species within stations, but there was broad overlap in delta D values. Although isotope ratios indicate that migrants at each station come from a wide range of latitudes, they are unable to provide much longitudinal discrimination. Band recoveries are sparse, but indicate that in general western Canadian warblers move southeast in fall, eastern birds move southwest, and there is a transition zone in the Great Lakes region. Combining knowledge of migratory direction with isotope results increases discrimination of breeding areas. Isotope results support fall migratory movements by Blackpoll Warbler (Dendroica striata) and Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus novaboracensis) that are more easterly than for other species, and in all study species, birds from more northern regions passed through southern Canada later in the season. Migration monitoring stations capture birds from broad areas of latitude, and migrants passing through each province appear to come from largely different portions of the Canadian breeding range, so a few stations placed in each province should suffice collectively to sample birds from most of the boreal forest. Migration monitoring in southern Canada, therefore, has the potential to monitor status of boreal forest birds in Canada that are unsampled by other monitoring programs.","[Allen, Martha L.] Trent Univ, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada",Trent University,NA,NA,"Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019; Wassenaar, Leonard/B-5996-2013","Wassenaar, Leonard/0000-0001-5532-0771",Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Trent University; Canadian Wildlife Service; Society of Canadian Ornithologists and Bird Studies Canada,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Trent University; Canadian Wildlife Service; Society of Canadian Ornithologists and Bird Studies Canada,"This project was only possible through collection of feathers by personnel at the cooperating banding stations.

Migration monitoring offers an attractive tool for additional assessment because migrants from inaccessible portions of the breeding range are included in counts. However, for site-specific trends to be combined into regional or range-wide population trends, the breeding ground origin of the migrants counted at each site must be known. Blackpolls have a loop migration pattern in which spring and fall migrants follow different paths, but very little is known about population-specific routes within North America. We used stable hydrogen isotope assays of tail feathers (52Hf, 4th rectrix) and wing-length measurements from migration monitoring sites across Canada and the northeastern United States to broadly delineate breeding/natal origins of blackpolls captured at those sites. Blackpolls captured on spring migration in southern Ontario and western Quebec had characteristics expected of birds from breeding range west of the Great Lakes. These birds travel northward from the eastern Gulf of Mexico to Canada east of the Great Lakes before turning westward to reach their final destination between northwestern Ontario and eastern portions of the Northwest Territories. Many birds sampled at Great Lakes sites prior to 2010, but not thereafter, had 52Hf and wing-length characteristics expected of breeding range in eastern Canada, suggesting differential rates of population change among regions. Estimates of migratory connectivity indicated considerable mixing of populations from different portions of the breeding range during migration.

Objectives Using forest-breeding birds, we (1) tested whether increased agricultural coverage resulted in species communities that were random or more similar than expected, (2) compared the relative influence of agriculture versus distance in structuring communities, and (3) tested whether different responses to agriculture among functional guilds leads to a change in functional diversity across gradients of agriculture. Methods Species abundances were sampled along 229 transects, each 8 km, using citizen science data assembled across a broad region of eastern Canada. Agricultural and natural land cover were each summed within three different-sized buffers (landscapes) around each transect. A null modeling approach was used to measure community similarity. Results Communities were most similar between landscapes that had high agricultural coverage and became more dissimilar as their respective landscapes differed more strongly in the amount of agriculture. Community dissimilarity increased with geographic distance up to about 200 km. Dissimilarity with increasing agriculture was largely due to the disappearance of Neotropical migrants, insectivores and foliage-gleaners from the community as agriculture increased. Functional diversity declined with increasing agriculture but less strongly than species richness and only when agriculture exceeded 40% of the landscape. Conclusions Our results support the hypothesis that increasing agricultural coverage produces a filtering towards communities of agriculture-tolerant forest birds with a loss of functional diversity and high site-to-site community similarity.","[Endenburg, Sarah; Mitchell, Greg W.; Fahrig, Lenore; Wilson, Scott] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Mitchell, Greg W.; Wilson, Scott] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Kirby, Patrick; Pasher, Jon] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Landscape Sci & Technol Div, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada",Carleton University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada,"Wilson, S (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",scott.wilson@canada.ca,"Fahrig, Lenore/C-6494-2012; Endenburg, Sarah/JXL-2768-2024; Wilson, Scott/AAC-7144-2021","Wilson, Scott/0000-0002-1210-8727",NA,NA,NA,NA,65,28,28,1,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,NA,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Analyses incorporating alternative hypotheses across spatial scales allow more robust evaluation of the ecological processes underlying population declines. Populations of many aerially insectivorous birds are declining, yet conservation efforts remain focused on habitat due to an absence of data on changes in prey availability. We evaluate the potential for prey and habitat availability at multiple spatial scales to influence a population of eastern whip-poor-wills (Antrostomus vociferous). We assess relationships between landcover (topographical map and satellite imagery) and insect abundance (moths and beetles from blacklight traps), and whip-poor-will distribution and abundance within eastern Canada using Ontario breeding bird atlas data (1980s and 2000s), acoustic recordings (regional), and point counts (local). Whip-poor-will occurrence in both atlas time periods was positively associated with forest area and fragmentation, but only a delayed effect of urban area explained reductions in detection. Contemporary regional whip-poor-will presence was positively related to moth abundance, and local whip-poor-will abundance was best predicted by area of open-canopy forest, anthropogenic linear disturbance density, and beetle abundance. Our finding that bird presence and abundance were associated with human activity and insect abundance across spatial scales suggests factors beyond habitat structure are likely driving population declines in whip-poor-wills and other aerial insectivores. This study demonstrates the importance of examining multiple hypotheses, including seasonally and locally variable food availability, across a range of spatial scales to direct conservation efforts.","[English, Philina A.; Green, David J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Nocera, Joseph J.; Pond, Bruce A.] Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada",Simon Fraser University; Trent University,"English, PA (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",paenglis@lakeheadu.ca,"Green, David/B-5096-2012","English, Philina/0000-0003-2992-6782; Nocera, Joseph/0000-0002-5913-8851","Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF) Species at Risk Research and Stewardship grants [SARRFO6-10-SFU, 114-11-QUEENSU]; NSERC; OMNRF Science and Research Branch and Environment Canada",Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF) Species at Risk Research and Stewardship grants; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); OMNRF Science and Research Branch and Environment Canada,"This research would not have been possible without the multitudes of Breeding Bird Atlas volunteers, and a team of dedicated field collaborators and technicians: M.

We collected data on nest initiation dates, nest elevations, hatching and hedging dates, survival rates of chicks and causes of mortality. Study sites were located on beaches where concentrations of plovers were found during the 1991 International Piping Plover Census. In 1992, plovers fledged a mean of 2.0 chicks per pair (n = 30), higher than the mean of 0.1 chicks per pair in 1993 (n = 39) and one of the highest recorded for the species. The major reason for this difference in hedging success between years was due to the loss of unhatched eggs by flooding. Using 1992 and 1993 nest site elevations and reproductive data, we developed a simulation model to assess the effects of flooding on piping plover reproductive success over the last 30 yr. Our model shows that fledging success at Lake Diefenbaker has been below the level recommended for sustainability of the species, in 24 of the last 30 yr. To maximize reproductive success at this location, we recommend that lake levels be managed to prevent or reduce flooding during the breeding season. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is therefore important that trends are quantified regionally, so that finer-scale assessments can be made about the plausible causes of declines and targeted conservation actions can be implemented. We estimated regional population trends for a grassland bird, the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), to compare with trends from provincial analyses used for risk assessment, to identify the regions contributing most substantially to population declines. We used 45 yr of count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, across 35 agricultural census divisions in southern Ontario, Canada, to develop spatially explicit hierarchical Bayesian models of regional population trends. Population trends were negative in 30 of 35 census divisions, 6 of which had 95% credibility intervals (CI) that did not include zero. In 34 of 35 census divisions, the CI included the provincial short-term recovery goal of a population trend of -1%. Between 1998 and 2011, corresponding to the time series used for provincial risk assessment, the CI for 3 of 21 negative trends did not include 0 or -1. Our results indicate that most regional trend estimates currently exceed the goal set out in the recovery strategy, insofar as they have been stable and not necessarily declining. This suggests a more optimistic picture of the state of Bobolink population trends than that obtained from analyses at broader spatial scales, which masked important regional variation. This result demonstrates the need for consideration of scale variance in trend estimation during risk assessment and management planning, and the application of spatially explicit trend estimation for small geographic areas to aid in this process.","[Ethier, Danielle M.; Nudds, Thomas D.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Ethier, DM (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",ethier.danielle@gmail.com,NA,NA,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's Species at Risk Stewardship Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [PGSD3-420471-2010]; University of Guelph,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's Species at Risk Stewardship Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); University of Guelph,"Funding for this work was provided in part by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's Species at Risk Stewardship Fund to T.D.N. and D.M.E., the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) grant PGSD3-420471-2010 to D.M.E., and the University of Guelph.

However, knowledge of the mechanisms that drive spatiotemporal patterns in population dynamics are needed to inform scale-variant policy development. Using hierarchical Bayesian models and variable selection, we determined by which mechanism(s), and to what extent, changes in quantity and quality of surrogate grassland habitats contributed to regional variation in population trends of an obligatory grassland bird, Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorous). We used North American Breeding Bird Survey data to develop spatially explicit models of regional population trends over 25 years across 35 agricultural census divisions in Ontario, Canada. We measured the strength of evidence for effects of land-use change on population trends over the entire study period and over five subperiods. Over the entire study period, one region (Perth) displayed strong evidence of population decline (95% Cl is entirely below 0); four regions displayed strong evidence of population increase (Bruce, Simcoe, Peterborough, and Northumberland). Population trends shifted spatially among subperiods, with more extreme declines later in time (1986-1990: 28% of 35 census divisions, 1991-1995: 46%, 1996-2000: 40%, 2001-2005: 66%, 2006-2010: 82%). Important predictors of spatial patterns in Bobolink population trends over the entire study period were human development and fragmentation. However, factors inferred to drive patterns in population trends were not consistent over space and time. This result underscores that effective threat identification (both spatially and temporally) and implementation of flexible, regionally tailored policies will be critical to realize efficient conservation of Bobolink and similar at-risk species.","[Ethier, Danielle M.; Nudds, Thomas D.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Summerlee Sci Complex, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Koper, Nicola] Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Manitoba,"Ethier, DM (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Summerlee Sci Complex, Guelph, ON, Canada.",ethier.danielle@gmail.com,NA,"Koper, Nicola/0000-0003-3576-9525",Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; IODE War Memorial Doctoral Scholarship,Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); IODE War Memorial Doctoral Scholarship,IODE War Memorial Doctoral Scholarship; Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,NA,81,10,12,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,NA,NA,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Resolving which species are declining and the ecological characteristics they have in common can offer insights into ecosystem changes and their underlying mechanisms. Using 20 years of citizen science data collected by the British Columbia Coastal Waterbird Survey, we examine species-specific trends in abundance of 50 species in the Salish Sea and 37 species along the outer Pacific Ocean coast that we considered to form the core wintering coastal bird community of British Columbia, Canada. Further, we explore whether ecological commonalities increase the likelihood of a species undergoing declines by testing the hypotheses that waterbird abundance trends are influenced by dietary specialization and migration distance to breeding grounds. Results suggest that most populations are stable (i.e., temporal trends are not significant) in both the Salish Sea (36 of 50 spp.) and Pacific coast (32 of 37 spp.) regions. Twelve species displayed significant decline trends in the Salish Sea, whereas two had significant increases. Along the Pacific coast, only three species displayed significant decline trends, and two significant increases. This result is corroborated by guild-specific trends indicating that waterbirds occupying the Salish Sea are faring significantly worse than those residing along the outer coastal regions, almost irrespective of dietary specialization or migration distance. Our results provide evidence that differential environmental pressures between the inner and outer coastal regions may be causing overall loss of wintering waterbirds within, or abundance shifts away from, the Salish Sea. Potential mechanisms responsible for these observed patterns are discussed, including environmental (e.g., climate) and human-induced (e.g., nutrient and chemical pollution) pressures. Collaborative, inter-disciplinary research priorities to help understand these mechanisms are suggested.","[Ethier, Danielle; Davidson, Pete; Sorenson, Graham H.; Jardine, Catherine B.; Lepage, Denis; Bradley, David W.] Birds Canada, Port Rowan, ON, Canada; [Barry, Karen L.] Habitat Conservat Trust Fdn, Victoria, BC, Canada",NA,"Ethier, D (corresponding author), POB 160,115 Front Rd, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada.",dethier@birdscanada.org,"Sorenson, Graham/U-2318-2019","Bradley, David William/0000-0002-5489-6258; Sorenson, Graham/0000-0002-1297-5943; Lepage, Denis/0009-0009-8494-5186","Canadian Wildlife Service, a branch of Environment and Climate Change Canada; Vancouver Foundation; BC Waterfowl Society; Public Conservation Assistance Fund of the Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation; TD Friends of the Environment Fund; Port of Vancouver; BC Field Ornithologists","Canadian Wildlife Service, a branch of Environment and Climate Change Canada; Vancouver Foundation; BC Waterfowl Society; Public Conservation Assistance Fund of the Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation; TD Friends of the Environment Fund; Port of Vancouver; BC Field Ornithologists","The British Columbia Coastal Waterbird Survey was conceived by a group of scientists, local naturalists, and conservation planners, and initiated in 1999 by Birds Canada.

This process requires standardized monitoring and robust analytical techniques, which can resolve trends at spatial scales of management interest while disentangling the influence that various data collection protocols can have on the interpretation of results. We used a 19-year citizen-science-collected dataset (2001-2019), the Nocturnal Owl Survey, to assess abundance trends in Barred Owl (Strix varia), Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus), and Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) at both fine and broad-scales. To achieve this, we used a spatially explicit modeling approach that facilitates the borrowing of information across spatial boundaries, allowing for more robust trend estimates at finer spatial scales. Further, we assessed the potential influence of the call-playback protocol on trend estimates. At fine spatial scales, we found that a data collection protocol that includes call playbacks provided more precise results to assess relative changes in abundance (i.e., reduced uncertainty). At broader spatial scales, trend estimates were unaffected by data collection methodology (i.e., silent listening versus call playback). Specifically, at the scale of the region or province, we found that populations of focal owl species in the Maritimes of Canada have remained stable over the past 19 years. However, at finer scales, trends are more variable and may create opportunities to test alternative hypotheses about drivers of population change and the effects of management actions at scales amenable to conservation action. The statistical analyses are anticipated to form a national, publicly accessible framework for status assessments of owls in Canada and will provide resource managers and researchers a base from which to evaluate the influence of land management and conservation practices on owl populations across the nation.","[Ethier, Danielle M.; Torrenta, Remi; Kouwenberg, Amy-Lee] Birds Canada, Port Rowan, ON, Canada",NA,"Ethier, DM (corresponding author), POB 160,115 Front Rd, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada.",dethier@birdscanada.org,"Torrenta, Rémi/ABD-6629-2021",NA,New Brunswick Wildlife Trust Fund; Province of New Brunswick; TD Friends of the Environment Foundation; PEI Wildlife Conservation Fund; New Brunswick Environmental Trust Fund; Shell Environmental Fund; Environment and Climate Change Canada,New Brunswick Wildlife Trust Fund; Province of New Brunswick; TD Friends of the Environment Foundation; PEI Wildlife Conservation Fund; New Brunswick Environmental Trust Fund; Shell Environmental Fund; Environment and Climate Change Canada,"Long-term and on-going financial support for the Nocturnal Owl Survey was provided by the New Brunswick Wildlife Trust Fund and the Province of New Brunswick.

Identifying the mechanisms driving changes in abundance or causing redistributions within this region necessitates a transboundary effort. Our analysis compiled data from both the British Columbia Coastal Waterbird Survey (BCCWS) and the Puget Sound Seabird Survey (PSSS) between 2009-2022 to assess broad-scale predator-prey interactions between Bald Eagles and priority sea ducks, using a multispecies occupancy model. Our results suggest that Bald Eagles more often than chance overlap with priority sea ducks in the Salish Sea. However, there was no evidence of second-order effects of latitude, longitude, or year on sea duck occurrence in the presence or absence of Bald Eagles, suggesting that these factors are acting independently. Our results not only help resource managers better understand the broad-scale interplay between predators and prey and the co-occurrence probability of priority sea ducks, but this analytical framework and data resource compilation also provide researchers with a foundation from which multi-species interactions and the mechanisms responsible can be disentangled across these transboundary waters.

Fundamental to any landscape conservation efforts is the identification of priority habitats to help target management efforts. Many avian species associated with prairie ecosystems have experienced population declines along with continued loss of prairie habitats. Additionally, given the long history of research in avian systems and the close grassland associations of some species, birds are excellent candidate taxa for the identification of priority habitats and can provide an informed starting point for multispecies assessments. We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (1997-2014) to develop species distribution models for 15 grassland bird species across the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada. Model performance varied widely across species. Ten species demonstrated good model performance (average Boyce Index > 0.64 across 5-fold cross validation). We used these 10 species to assess the influence of habitat covariates on the relative probability of occurrence, to compare the spatial scales of selection, and to generate multispecies habitat priority maps. Of the nine habitat covariates considered, most species predictably demonstrated positive associations with grassland habitats and avoidance of areas of high tree and shrub cover. Two covariates representing wetland abundance were also frequently included in the top models. The area covered by wetlands (w.area) was present in the top model for 5 of 10 species with a consistently estimated negative coefficient. However, a covariate, which represented the number of wetland basins (w.basins), was present in the top model for 8 of 10 species with an estimated positive coefficient for all but 1 species, representing a preference for more heterogeneous wetland landscapes. The larger spatial scales we considered tended to have greater explanatory power than smaller spatial scales and were thus more prevalent in the top models. The multispecies priority habitat maps that we produced can be used for future assessments of potential habitat management actions. Our work provides a critical foundation for the incorporation of grassland bird conservation goals into on-going landscape-planning initiatives in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada.","[Fedy, Bradley C.; Row, Jeffrey R.] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Devries, James H.; Howerter, David W.] Ducks Unlimited Canada, Stonewall, MB, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Fedy, BC (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Environm Resources & Sustainabil, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",bfedy@uwaterloo.ca,"Row, Jeffrey/M-6126-2013; Fedy, Bradley/A-6017-2015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,71,11,12,1,20,Resilience Alliance,Dedham,"231 Bussey St., Beckwith and Brown, Dedham, Massachusetts, UNITED STATES",1712-6568,NA,NA,AVIAN CONSERV ECOL,Avian Conserv.

Whether the gradient in environmental influence occurs in the absence of a gradient in abundance is not known. We tested whether duck populations on the periphery of their main breeding region were more strongly affected by environmental stochasticity and less abundant than at the core. LocationThe Prairie Pothole Region of central United States and Canada MethodsWe used the North American Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey to model the dynamics of 10 duck species at 1059 sites spanning 1961-2012. We used the North American Breeding Bird Survey to measure abundance at the same sites, averaged over the same time span. We used structural equation models to characterize relationships among a site's distance from the regional centre, a site's abundance, and the degree to which a site's ducks were affected by environmental stochasticity. ResultsEnvironmental stochasticity never strongly contributed to population dynamics in the region's core. However, we did not find a linear increase in environmental stochasticity with increasing distance from the core. For seven species, we found that environmental stochasticty was stronger in sites of lower abundance. For only two species did average abundance decline from the region's core to periphery. Main conclusionsVariability in the magnitude of environmental stochasticity follows coarse spatial differences in wetland productivity. Yet, among peripheral sites, the contribution of the environment to population dynamics varies, possibly reflecting the importance of the local environment and dispersal.","[Feldman, Richard E.; Murray, Dennis L.] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Anderson, Michael G.; Howerter, DavidW.] Ducks Unlimited Canada, Inst Wetland & Waterfowl Res, Stonewall, MB R0C 2Z0, Canada",Trent University,"Feldman, RE (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Cient YucatanA C, Unidad Recursos Nat, Calle 43 130 Colonia Chuburna de Hidalgo, Merida 97200, Yucatan, Mexico.",richard.feldman@cicy.mx,NA,NA,"Canada Research Chairs program; Institute for Wetland and Waterfowl Research, Ducks Unlimited Canada","Canada Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs); Institute for Wetland and Waterfowl Research, Ducks Unlimited Canada","We thank all of those who have diligently surveyed for ducks and birds as part of the North American Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey and the North American Breeding Bird Survey.

We used the volunteer-collected raw breeding bird evidence data set to analyze the effects of sampling biases on spatial distribution of observed breeding bird species and implemented regression tree analysis (Random Forests) to examine the influence of productivity, ambient energy, and habitat heterogeneity on independently measured breeding bird richness. Results indicated that total breeding species richness is correlated with total survey effort (alpha < 0.001). By stratifying species richness by survey effort, we observed that ambient energy is the top-ranked environmental predictor of breeding bird richness across BC, which, when used in combination with a number of other environmental variables, explains similar to 40% of the variation in richness. Using our modeled relationships, we predicted breeding bird species richness in the areas of BC not presently surveyed between three and six hours. The majority of the productive Boreal Plains, the southern portion of the Taiga Plains region, the lowlands of the Southern and Central Interior, along the Rocky Mountain Trench, and the coastal areas of the Georgia Depression are predicted to have the highest categories of breeding richness (35-57 unique species). Our results support ongoing species diversity gradient research, which identifies ambient energy as an important factor influencing species diversity distributions in the Northern Hemisphere. By linking breeding bird richness to environmental data derived from remotely sensed data and systematically collected climate data, we demonstrate the potential to monitor shifts in ambient energy as a surrogate for vertebrate habitat condition affecting population levels. By analyzing the influence of survey effort on species richness metrics, we also highlight the need to consider adding attributes to the raw breeding bird data set to describe observer experience, such as hours or seasons spent surveying, and provide survey dates to allow greater flexibility for removing survey bias. These additions can increase the utility of atlas data for species richness studies useful for conservation planning.","[Fitterer, Jessica L.; Nelson, Trisalyn A.] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Spatial Pattern Anal & Res Lab, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada; [Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, IRSS, Dept Forest Resources Management, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Wulder, Michael A.] Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada",University of Victoria; University of British Columbia; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Fitterer, JL (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Spatial Pattern Anal & Res Lab, POB 3060, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada.",jessyka@uvic.ca,"; Wulder, Michael/J-5597-2016; Coops, Nicholas/J-1543-2012","Nelson, Trisalyn/0000-0003-2537-6971; Wulder, Michael/0000-0002-6942-1896; Coops, Nicholas/0000-0002-0151-9037",British Columbia Innovation Council (BCIC); Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP); Canadian Forest Service (CFS) Pacific Forestry Centre (PFC); University of British Columbia (UBC),British Columbia Innovation Council (BCIC); Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP); Canadian Forest Service (CFS) Pacific Forestry Centre (PFC)(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service); University of British Columbia (UBC),"We thank the British Columbia Breeding Bird Atlas and all of its partners for supplying breeding bird atlas data, as well as all of the volunteer participants who gathered data for the project.

Chimney Swifts (Chaetura pelagica) are a model species to test this hypothesis because nest site use and availability is easily assessed. To determine if nest site availability is a limiting factor for Chimney Swifts, we established a volunteer-based survey to inventory and describe chimneys (n = 928) that were used or unused by swifts. A logistic regression model showed that swifts preferred chimneys with a greater length exposed above the roofline and greater inside area, which were not associated with residential buildings. The average chimney used by swifts extended 2.86 m above the roofline with an internal area of 10,079 cm(2). The regression model represents the range of nest-site conditions that swifts will tolerate; this was used to build a linear discriminant function (ldf) that had an I-index of 82 % (measure of prediction success). We applied the ldf coefficients to predict chimney occupancy in three southern Ontario communities. Of 366 open chimneys, the ldf classified 139 as suitable but only 24.4 % were occupied by swifts. Given that > 75 % of suitable sites were unoccupied, swifts are likely not experiencing competition from habitat saturation. Our results suggest that Chimney Swift populations, and likely other aerially-foraging insectivorous birds, are limited primarily by other processes not measured in this study, such as changes in prey.","[van Stam, Elisabeth; Badzinski, Debra S.] Bird Studies Canada, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada; [Nocera, Joseph J.] Trent Univ, Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Badzinski, Debra S.] Stantec Consulting Ltd, Stoney Creek, ON L8J 0B4, Canada",Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry; Trent University,"Badzinski, DS (corresponding author), Stantec Consulting Ltd, 200-835 Paramount Dr, Stoney Creek, ON L8J 0B4, Canada.",debra.badzinski@stantec.com,NA,"Nocera, Joseph/0000-0002-5913-8851",Government of Ontario; Government of Canada,Government of Ontario; Government of Canada(CGIAR),"We are grateful for the dedication of Ontario SwiftWatch participants, whose efforts in collecting data for this project made this study possible.

We evaluated the influences of regional climate and land-use variables on wetland breeding birds in the Canada section of Bird Conservation Region 11 (CA-BCR11), the Prairie Potholes. We used bird abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, land-use data from the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration, and weather data from the National Climatic Data and Information Archive to model effects of regional environmental variables on bird abundance. Models were constructed a priori using information from published habitat associations in the literature, and fitting was performed with WinBUGS using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Both land-use and climate variables contributed to predicting bird abundance in CA-BCR11, although climate predictors contributed the most to improving model fit. Examination of regional effects of climate and land use on wetland birds in CA-BCR11 revealed relationships with environmental covariates that are often overlooked by small-scale habitat studies. Results from these Studies can be used to improve conservation and management planning for regional populations of avifauna.","N Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; US Geol Survey, Upper Midw Environm Sci Ctr, Bismarck, ND 58501 USA; US Geol Survey, Upper Midw Environm Sci Ctr, La Crosse, WI 54603 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Forcey, GM (corresponding author), Pandion Syst, 4603 NW 6th St, Gainesville, FL 32609 USA.",research@gregforcey.com,"Forcey, Greg/K-5589-2019; Thogmartin, Wayne/A-4461-2008","Thogmartin, Wayne/0000-0002-2384-4279; Forcey, Greg/0000-0003-0461-5734",NA,NA,NA,NA,62,31,45,1,33,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,NA,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

In Alberta, achievement of equivalent land capability to that present before disturbance is a regulatory requirement of reclamation certification. We compared landbird abundance and productivity indices from mist-netting data collected in 2011-2013 using the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol with local habitat covariates at 35 monitoring stations in natural, reclaimed, and disturbed habitats. Principal component analysis of habitat covariates explained 83% of the variation in 20 habitat-structure variables. We found significant relationships between habitat covariates and captures of adult birds, young birds, and/or the probability of capturing a young bird (productivity) for 12 landbird species; in some cases, capture responses contrasted with productivity responses to habitat variables. Responses to reclamation age were as expected, given habitat preferences of our target species. Positive responses to reclamation age from obligate forest-dwelling species take more years to become evident than those for species preferring successional-stage habitats, while one species that prefers open, grassland habitats appeared to decline with reclamation age, presumably due to habitat succession. Application of the MAPS protocol as a tool to evaluate and track the performance of reclaimed and disturbed habitats is demonstrated, with landbird abundance and productivity indices in natural habitats being useful indicators of equivalent land capability.","[Foster, Kenneth R.; Godwin, Christine M.] Owl Moon Environm Inc, 324 Killdeer Way, Ft McMurray, AB T9K 0R3, Canada; [Pyle, Peter; Saracco, James F.] Inst Bird Populat, POB 1346, Point Reyes Stn, CA 94956 USA",NA,"Foster, KR (corresponding author), Owl Moon Environm Inc, 324 Killdeer Way, Ft McMurray, AB T9K 0R3, Canada.",kfoster@owlmoon.ca,"Saracco, James/H-6520-2019","Saracco, James/0000-0001-5084-1834",Syncrude Canada Ltd.; Hammerstone Corporation; Canadian Natural Resources Limited; Cenovus Energy; ConocoPhillips Canada; Devon Energy; Husky Oil Operations Ltd.; Imperial Oil Ltd.; Suncor Energy; TOTAL EP Canada; Oil Sands Developers Group,Syncrude Canada Ltd.; Hammerstone Corporation; Canadian Natural Resources Limited; Cenovus Energy; ConocoPhillips Canada; Devon Energy; Husky Oil Operations Ltd.; Imperial Oil Ltd.; Suncor Energy; TOTAL EP Canada; Oil Sands Developers Group,"Funding in support of this project is provided by Syncrude Canada Ltd., Hammerstone Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy, ConocoPhillips Canada, Devon Energy, Husky Oil Operations Ltd., Imperial Oil Ltd., Suncor Energy, and TOTAL E&P Canada, and the Oil Sands Developers Group.

A minimum of 791 owls on 84 routes in 1995, and 392 owls on 88 routes in 1996; nine different species were detected. Playback improved the response rate for Barred (Strix varia), Boreal (Aegolius funereus), Northern Saw-whet (Aegolius acadicus) and possibly Great Gray (Strix nebulosa) Owls, and reduced variance among surveys for Barred Owls. Relatively few, long stops produced the most efficient survey for Barred Owls, while more numerous, shorter stops were optimal for Boreal and Northern Saw-whet Owls. Power estimates suggest that about 50 routes per species should be adequate to detect a uniform 20 percent decline over 10 years (2.2 percent per year) for Boreal and Northern Saw-whet Owls, and a 50 percent decline for Barred and Great Gray Owls (6.7 percent per year). However, some species were detected on many fewer than 50 routes, and models of uniform population changes may not be relevant for owls. For example, 60-80 percent fewer Northern Saw-whet and Boreal Owls (P < 0.001) were detected in 1996 than 1995 on routes that were run in both years, possibly related to emigration of many of these owls out of the study areas the preceding winter.","Long Point Bird Observ, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada",NA,"Francis, CM (corresponding author), Long Point Bird Observ, POB 160, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,6,6,0,11,"US DEPT AGR, FOREST SERV, N CENT RES STN",ST PAUL,"1992 FOLWELL AVENUE, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA",0363-616X,NA,NA,US FOR SERV T R NC,NA,NA,190,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,175,184,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,Ecology; Ornithology; Zoology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,BM08A,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000077557600027,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current knowledge suggests that agricultural composition and intensity are dominant drivers of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, with variable effects of agricultural configuration and landscape diversity. The aim of this study was to determine the relative effects of agricultural composition, intensity, configuration, and landscape diversity on the species diversity of six distinct bird guilds on the landscape scale in a large and complex landscape in Ontario, Canada. We found that agricultural configuration, specifically patchiness of croplands, and to a lesser degree forage lands, was the strongest predictor of bird diversity for three of the six bird guilds considered (forest, shrubland, and town). The effects of increased cropland patchiness were variable, with forest and shrubland bird diversity increasing from small to moderate patchiness, and town bird diversity declining from moderate to high patchiness. Grassland birds, a group of considerable conservation concern, increased near linearly with increased agricultural land cover in the landscape, highlighting the need to consider agricultural lands in conservation planning for this species group. Woodland bird diversity declined significantly with all increasing measures of agricultural intensity, including the proportion of high-intensity agriculture and larger patches of agricultural land. Wetland birds were unique from the other guilds, showing primarily a strong association between diversity of land cover types and guild-level bird diversity. Surprisingly, increased cover of agricultural lands, which we predicted to be a dominant driver of guild-level bird diversity declines due to habitat loss, had weak, non-significant effects relative to the other land use variable being tested, except for the positive association with grassland birds. Our findings suggest that a mix of management strategies should be employed to consider the varying effects of agricultural lands on different bird guilds, such as the inclusion of agricultural land in conservation strategies for grassland species and further managing the configuration of agricultural lands to enhance biodiversity of agricultural landscapes.","[Frei, Barbara; Bennett, Elena M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21,111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Kerr, Jeremy T.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Stn A, Box 450, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Frei, B (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21,111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",barbara.frei@mail.mcgill.ca; elena.bennett@mcgill.ca; jkerr@uottawa.ca,"Bennett, Elena/A-9553-2008","Frei, Barbara/0000-0003-0202-5386; Bennett, Elena/0000-0003-3944-2925",Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la nature et technologies (FRQNT); NSERC; University of Ottawa Research Chair in Macroecology and Conservation; EWR Steacie Fellowship,Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la nature et technologies (FRQNT); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); University of Ottawa Research Chair in Macroecology and Conservation; EWR Steacie Fellowship,"BF was supported by a Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la nature et technologies (FRQNT).

Through two case studies, we examined the integration of traditional ecological knowledge and scientific knowledge by emphasizing their complementarity across spatial and temporal scales. We expected that combining Inuit traditional ecological knowledge and scientific knowledge would expand the spatial and temporal scales of currently documented knowledge on the arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) and the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), two important tundra species. Using participatory approaches in Mittimatalik (also known as Pond Inlet), Nunavut, Canada, we documented traditional ecological knowledge about these species and found that, in fact, it did expand the spatial and temporal scales of current scientific knowledge for local arctic fox ecology. However, the benefits were not as apparent for snow goose ecology, probably because of the similar spatial and temporal observational scales of the two types of knowledge for this species. Comparing sources of knowledge at similar scales allowed us to gain confidence in our conclusions and to identify areas of disagreement that should be studied further. Emphasizing complementarities across scales was more powerful for generating new insights and hypotheses. We conclude that determining the scales of the observations that form the basis for traditional ecological knowledge and scientific knowledge represents a critical step when evaluating the benefits of integrating these two types of knowledge. This is also critical when examining the congruence or contrast between the two types of knowledge for a given subject.","[Gagnon, Catherine A.; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Canada Res Chair Conservat No Ecosyst, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Gagnon, Catherine A.; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski,"Gagnon, CA (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, Canada Res Chair Conservat No Ecosyst, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.",NA,"Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016","Newman, Gregory/0000-0003-0503-5782",NA,NA,NA,NA,73,131,177,2,161,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,NA,NA,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

So far, more emphasis has been given to passerine species than to any other groups of birds, possibly because of the availability of long-term data sets. Our objective was to study the effect of climate change on spring arrival date and breeding chronology of Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis), a short-distance migrant with a diverse diet. Based on Etudes des Populations d'Oiseaux du Quebec (EPOQ) checklists, we found that gulls arrived in southern Quebec five days earlier in 2012 than in 1971. Sporadic observations in three nearby colonies indicated that Ring-billed gulls laid eggs eight days earlier in 2012 than they did in 1978. Both arrival and laying dates closely fit temperature warming. Because of their diverse diet, Ring-billed Gulls always have access to some food resources during the breeding period making a mismatch between phenology and food abundance unlikely. Continuous warming may enhance the use of agricultural lands by gulls before and during the breeding period. However, this may not be sufficient to compensate for a reduction of refuse accessibility at landfills that have implemented deterrence programs.","[Giroux, Jean-Francois] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Patenaude-Monette, Martin; Lagarde, Florent; Racine, Francois] Univ Quebec, Grp Rech EcolComportementale & Anim, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mousseau, Pierre] Pierre Mousseau Biologiste Conseil, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Giroux, JF (corresponding author), POB 8888,Stn Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",giroux.jean-francois@uqam.ca,"Giroux, Jean-François/L-7945-2019","Patenaude-Monette, Martin/0000-0001-7272-2115",Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada; Waste Management; BFI Canada; Chamard et Associes; Falcon Environmental Services; I.C.I.

We used data from eBird and from standardized ship-based surveys to document the timing and magnitude of the increase. Results show that densities have been increasing in waters off Nova Scotia since 2007 and are now of similar magnitude to those observed on George's Bank in the late 1980s, which suggests that birds are targeting cooler, more productive waters on the Scotian Shelf during migration. Continued monitoring using a variety of survey techniques will help identify important marine areas for this trans-equatorial migrant, and identify potential threats as birds move into areas not previously exploited.","[Gjerdrum, Carina] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, 45 Alderney Dr, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N6, Canada; [Loch, John] Loch Consulting Serv, Bedford, NS B4A 4K4, Canada; [Fifield, David A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, 6 Bruce St, Mt Pearl, NF A1N 4T3, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada,"Gjerdrum, C (corresponding author), Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, 45 Alderney Dr, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N6, Canada.",carina.gjerdrum@canada.ca,NA,NA,Environmental Studies Research Funds (ESRF),Environmental Studies Research Funds (ESRF),"We thank all of the observers who conducted the surveys at sea as well as science staff, and ships' officers and personnel for support at sea, especially the Canadian Coast Guard and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

Correction factors were applied to all nest count data so all results from the different count types would be comparable. The total number of heron pairs within the census areas was determined. Information on 1,613 colonies across the province was collected from 1976-91, of which 48% had become extinct by 1991 and 67% had become established since 1976.

Our objectives were to summarize the current state of knowledge of harlequin duck abundance and distribution in Eastern Canada, and assess trends in wintering abundance across regions over the past 30+ years. Abundance estimates were generated from targeted surveys with thorough spatial coverage of major wintering areas on insular Newfoundland (NL), Nova Scotia (NS), and New Brunswick (NB) between 2015 and 2018, complemented by regional trends estimated from Christmas Bird Count (CBC) data collected at 12 sites across the same wintering range between 1988 and 2021. Overall, targeted surveys indicated that numbers have increased and distributions have expanded beyond historically surveyed regions, particularly in NS. This was supported by trends from CBC data, with steep average increases (mean lambda > 1.05) on most CBC circles in Eastern Canada since 1988 or later. Using localized annual rates of mean population change from CBC data to project counts from dedicated surveys, we suggest wintering areas in the provinces of NL, NS, and NB may currently be supporting a combined total of 5682 birds (95% CI 5065-6354) in 2022, well exceeding the recovery target of 3000 individuals listed in the 2007 management plan. Our findings indicate that the eastern population is in recovery, but also emphasize that a consistent, dedicated monitoring program would enable managers to confidently evaluate management actions, and to respond most effectively should regional trends slow or reverse.","[Gutowsky, S.

In Nova Scotia, Canada, the breeding population of American woodcock (Scolopax minor) has been in decline over the past 50 years, likely in part because of reduced availability of habitat. We aimed to identify regions in Nova Scotia expected to support high numbers of woodcock, and whether monitoring efforts sufficiently capture the distribution of habitat. We generated a species distribution model to identify areas of highest relative predicted abundance and optimal habitat based on 15 years of standardized singing ground survey monitoring conducted along 50 routes and a candidate set of 56 habitat variables representative of composition and configuration at each of 2 ecologically relevant spatial scales (i.e., describing habitat immediately available to displaying males and the broader landscape used by the local breeding population). The species distribution model indicated extensive areas of optimal habitat in the central mainland characterized by moist organic soils, large, irregularly shaped patches of early successional forest, and large patches of open space created by developed, urban areas. We identified additional smaller pockets of habitat throughout the province likely to support relatively high local abundances. Much of the area identified as optimal habitat is not currently surveyed by singing ground survey routes. Expanding survey route coverage into regions identified as potentially optimal habitat could help clarify drivers of population declines. Overall, partnerships with provincial forest managers will be key to ensuring the maintenance of woodcock habitat while balancing the needs of a suite of avian species toward the goal of biodiversity conservation in Nova Scotia.","[Gutowsky, Sarah E.; Mallory, Mark L.] Acadia Univ, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada; [Gutowsky, Lee F.

Various lines of evidence indicate recent localized changes in eider abundance, particularly in the Gulf of Maine, where the most dramatic oceanic changes in the Northwest Atlantic are also underway. A range-wide overview of shifts in local abundance is needed to understand the geographic extent of changes in winter distribution, however, only the Canadian portion of their wintering range has been thoroughly and repeatedly surveyed by air in the last two decades (since 2003). We used these Canadian aerial survey data in combination with data from the Christmas Bird Count (CBC), a citizen science general bird census, to generate estimates of localized changes in abundance over a multi-decadal time series across the dresseri wintering range. CBC trends from the periods 1980-1999 and 2000-2020 were derived from negative binomial regressions and indicated an overall shift from mostly stable (lambda = 1) or positive (lambda > 1) localized trends in earlier years in the central region of the wintering range toward negative trends (lambda < 1) in the most recent 20 years. Wintering numbers in Nova Scotia and the Bay of Fundy south through Maine showed the steepest shifts, where accelerating negative trends of lambda = 0.85 -0.95 have occurred since 2000. Many CBC sites in Massachusetts also shifted to negative trends, although a small number of sites from Cape Cod south have reported high counts in recent years resulting in locally high lambda. Numbers in the far southern extent of the range also grew substantially, albeit with low numbers overall. CBCs at higher latitudes, in southeast Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, showed mostly stable or increasing trends. CBC coverage in the Canadian portion of the range is relatively poor, however, data from multiple years of aerial surveys in Canada corroborated CBC trends. The consistent and widespread nature of the declines in local abundance throughout the entire Gulf of Maine and surrounding ecosystems, from Nova Scotia to Massachusetts, suggests a large-scale redistribution away from the center of the overwinter range. Our confirmation of suspected spatial patterns in trends of American Common Eiders further supports the need for cross-jurisdictional coordination on the prioritization of harvest management and habitat conservation efforts among regions for this species.","[Gutowsky, Sarah E.; Mallory, Mark L.] Acadia Univ, Wolfville, NS, Canada; [Robertson, Gregory J.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Mt Pearl, NF, Canada; [McLellan, Nic R.] Ducks Unlimited Canada, Atlantic Reg Off, Amherst, NS, Canada; [Gilliland, Scott G.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Sackville, NB, Canada",Acadia University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Gutowsky, SE (corresponding author), Acadia Univ, Wolfville, NS, Canada.",sarahegutowsky@gmail.com,"Mallory, Mark/A-1952-2017; Robertson, Greg/AAI-5849-2020","Robertson, Greg/0000-0001-8452-5506",Mitacs and Ducks Unlimited Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,Mitacs and Ducks Unlimited Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"This project began as a plenary presentation at the 2019 North American Duck Symposium in Winnipeg, MB, Canada (S.

To address this issue, over 1,000 biologists and volunteers from 10 nations collaborated in the 1991 International Piping Plover Census. Approximately 2,099 sites were censused yielding the highest number of breeding (5,482 adults) and wintering (3,451 birds) Piping Plovers ever recorded. Most winter birds occur-red in Texas (55%) and along other United States Gulf Coast sites (93%). Among winter birds, 51% used ocean beaches, 43% used sand or algal flats in protected bays, and 6% used areas where protected bays met ocean beaches. Breeding birds were widely distributed in small populations in the Northern Great Plains/Prairie (63.2%) and on the Atlantic Coast (36%). Few birds (N = 39) remain on the Great Lakes. Habitat use among breeding birds varied considerably across the species range. While most Atlantic (93.9%) and Great Lakes (100%) birds used sandy beaches, 59.6% of Northern Great Plains/Prairie birds used shorelines around small alkaline lakes, 18.2% used large reservoir beaches, 19.9% used river islands and adjacent sand pits, 2% used beaches on large lakes, and 0.4% used industrial pond shorelines. Change in status from previous censuses was difficult to determine. New populations were found in Montana, Colorado, and Saskatchewan, Canada; however, the distribution gap between Atlantic and Northern Great Plains/Prairie Piping Plover distribution grows as numbers decline in Minnesota; Manitoba, Canada; and the Great Lakes. Repeated international censuses every five years and a better assessment of reproductive success in local populations will help determine future population trends for the species.","CLEMSON UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",Clemson University,"CLEMSON UNIV, US FISH & WILDLIFE SERV, S CAROLINA COOPERAT FISH & WILDLIFE RES UNIT, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33,34,40,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,NA,CONDOR,Condor,FEB,95,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,145,156,NA,10.2307/1369396,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1369396,NA,NA,12,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,KQ367,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:A1993KQ36700015,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, data reliability is low due to lack of survey routes in the northern boreal and taiga ecozones, areas encompassing much of the breeding range of both species. Locally in the southern Manitoba prairie ecozone, reliability of long-term trend data is also considered low and these data suggest that Horned Grebe populations are declining faster than the continental trend and that Red-necked Grebe populations are increasing rapidly. The lack of current quantitative information on population densities of these two species in southern Manitoba prompted me to compare 1970s historical data from two sites to recent data collected at the same locations in 2008-2016.

Location North America. Methods We evaluated the leading hypotheses on biophysical factors affecting species richness for Breeding Bird Survey routes from areas with little influence of human activities. We then derived a best model based on information theory, and used this model to extrapolate SK across North America based on the biophysical predictor variables. The predictor variables included the latest and probably most accurate satellite and simulation-model derived products. Results The best model of SK included mean annual and inter-annual variation in gross primary productivity and potential evapotranspiration. This model explained 70% of the variation in landbird species richness. Geographically, predicted SK was lowest at higher latitudes and in the arid west, intermediate in the Rocky Mountains and highest in the eastern USA and the Great Lakes region of the USA and Canada. Main conclusions Areas that are high in SK but low in human density are high priorities for protection, and areas high in SK and high in human density are high priorities for restoration. Human density was positively related to SK, indicating that humans select environments similar to those with high bird species richness. Federal lands were disproportionately located in areas of low predicted SK.","[Hansen, Andrew J.; Phillips, Linda Bowers] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Flather, Curtis H.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Robison-Cox, Jim] Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Hansen, AJ (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, 310 Lewis Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",hansen@montana.edu,"Flather, Curtis/G-3577-2012","Flather, Curtis/0000-0002-0623-3126",National Aeronautics and Space Administration [EOS/03-0000-0668],National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We gratefully acknowledge support for this research from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (EOS/03-0000-0668).

Ravens are generalist predators known to depredate the eggs and young of several sensitive species. Quantifying raven population increases at multiple spatial scales across North America will help wildlife resource managers identify areas where population increases present the greatest risk to species conservation. We used a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach to analyze trends of standardized raven counts from 1966 to 2018 using Breeding Bird Survey data within each Level I and II ecoregion of the United States and Canada. We also compared raven abundance within and outside the distributions of 9 sensitive or endangered species. Although we found substantial evidence that raven populations have increased across North America, populations varied in growth rates and relative abundances among regions. We found 73% of Level I (11/15) and II (25/34) ecoregions demonstrated positive annual population growth rates ranging from 0.2-9.4%. We found higher raven abundance inside versus outside the distributions of 7 of the 9 sensitive species included in our analysis. Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus) had the highest discrepancy, with 293% more ravens within compared to outside of their range, followed by greater sandhill crane (Antigone canadensis tabida; 280%), and greater sage-grouse (C. urophasianus; 204%). Only 2 species, least tern (Sternula antillarum) and piping plover (Charadrius melodus), indicated lower raven abundance within relative to outside their distributions. Our findings will help wildlife resource managers identify regional trends in abundance of ravens and anticipate which sensitive species are at greatest risk from elevated raven populations. Future research directed at identifying the underlying regional drivers of these trends could help elucidate the most appropriate and responsive management actions and, thereby, guide the development of raven population management plans to mitigate impacts to sensitive species.","[Harju, Seth M.] Heron Ecol LLC, POB 235, Kingston, ID 83839 USA; [Coates, Peter S.; Dettenmaier, Seth J.; Chenaille, Michael P.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Dixon Field Stn, 800 Business Pk Dr,Suite D, Dixon, CA 95620 USA; [Dinkins, Jonathan B.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Anim & Rangeland Sci, 2921 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Jackson, Pat J.] Nevada Dept Wildlife, 6980 Sierra Pkwy,Suite 120, Reno, NV 89511 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Oregon State University,"Harju, SM (corresponding author), Heron Ecol LLC, POB 235, Kingston, ID 83839 USA.",seth@heronecological.com,NA,NA,Nevada Department of Wildlife; U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area,Nevada Department of Wildlife; U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area,"The authors would like to thank S.

The status and trends of forest-associated species is one indicator of SFM. though it is under utilized due to challenges with indicator selection and data availability. This paper demonstrates and tests an indicator selection methodology which combines Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data and LandSat land cover data to identify indicator guilds, or groups of indicator species, for a series of forest composition and configuration attributes in the Great Lakes St. Lawrence forest region. Guild performance is tested at independent sites within the region and compared with that of guilds assembled using known species' habitat preferences, and abundance trends are reported for two periods: 1990-2007 and 1967-2007. Guilds assembled using the method proposed here describe more variation in forest composition (r-sq(adj): 41-76) than those assembled using known habitat preferences alone (r-sq(adj): 17-58). Forest configuration guilds, which were not compared with existing guilds, also describe a large proportion of variation in configuration attributes (r-sq(adj): 47-76). Guild abundance remained stable over the long and short term for most guilds with the exception of the wetland guild, which increased moderately over the long-term, and the deciduous guild which increased moderately over the short-term. Despite challenges associated with the use of bird guilds as indicators of forest composition and configuration, results presented here suggest that indicator guilds may provide useful information regarding the status and trends of regional scale forest composition and configuration attributes.

We quantitatively reviewed studies of bird management in Canada and the United States to evaluate the relative efficacy of 4 common management interventions and to determine variables associated with their success. We compared how livestock exclusion, prescribed burning, removal of predators, and removal of cowbirds (Molothrus ater) affect bird nest success and used meta-regression to evaluate the influence of species and study-specific covariates on management outcomes. On average, all 4 management interventions increased nest success. When common species and threatened, endangered, or declining species (as defined by long-term trend data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey) were analyzed together, predator removal was the most effective management option. The difference in mean nest success between treatment and control plots in predator-removal experiments was more than twice that of either livestock exclusion or prescribed burning. However, when we considered management outcomes from only threatened, endangered, or declining species, livestock exclusions resulted in the greatest mean increase in nest success, more than twice that of the 3 other treatments. Our meta-regression results indicated that between-species variation accounted for approximately 86%, 40%, 35%, and 7% of the overall variation in the results of livestock-exclusion, prescribed-burn, predator-removal, and cowbird-removal studies, respectively. However, the covariates we tested explained significant variation only in outcomes among prescribed-burn studies. The difference in nest success between burned and unburned plots displayed a significant, positive trend in association with time since fire and was significantly larger in grasslands than in woodlands. Our results highlight the importance of comparative studies on management effects in developing efficient and effective conservation strategies.","[Hartway, Cynthia; Mills, L.

This study examined the potential contribution that Inuit TEK (which is one aspect of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit or Inuit traditional knowledge) could offer to detect and monitor avian cholera and other disease-related mortality among Northern Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima borealis) breeding in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Avian cholera is an infectious disease (Pasteurella multocida) that has been a major conservation issue because of its potential to cause high rates of disease and mortality in several bird species in repeating epizootics; it has spread geographically in North America since the 1940s. In 2004, Inuit hunters from Ivujivik, Nunavik, Quebec, were the first to detect avian disease outbreaks among Northern Common Eiders nesting in northeastern Hudson Bay and western Hudson Strait. Laboratory analysis of bird tissues confirmed avian cholera in that region. From 2007 to 2009, we collected Inuit TEK about mortality among Common Eiders and other bird species north and west of where the outbreaks were first detected. During interviews in the communities of Kimmirut, Cape Dorset, Coral Harbour, and Igloolik, Nunavut, Canada (n = 40), Inuit participants reported seeing a total of 8 Common Eiders and 41 specimens of other bird species either sick or dead in northern Hudson Strait, Hudson Bay, and Foxe Basin. Most of the observed disease and mortality events were at sea, on sea ice, or on small nesting islands. Such events probably would have gone undetected by biologists, who were mainly monitoring avian cholera outbreaks on large nesting islands in that region. Inuit participants readily recalled details about the timing, location, and numbers of sick and dead birds that they observed. Some reported signs of disease that were consistent with avian cholera. Inuit also revealed knowledge of two past bird mass mortality events that took place about 60 years and a century ago. Those interviewed indicated that that bird mass mortality events potentially caused by avian cholera had not occurred in the study area prior to 2004, supporting the hypothesis that avian cholera emerged only recently in the eastern Canadian Arctic. This study demonstrated that TEK can be a valuable tool for monitoring future avian cholera outbreaks and other wildlife diseases in remote regions.","[Henri, Dominique A.; Gilchrist, H.

It is imperative to identify factors that influence population trends for declining species, but demographic parameters can be especially challenging to quantify for birds, such as Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus), that breed in locations that are logistically difficult to access. At least two disjunct Whimbrel populations breed in remote and difficult to access northern latitudes but migrate through the heavily populated North American Atlantic Coast during autumn migration. Here, we capitalize on the Whimbrel migrations through the more populated coastal areas to age Whimbrels in photographs uploaded to the citizen science website, eBird, to identify the timing and location of juvenile Whimbrels staging for trans-Atlantic migratory flights. Mean photograph dates for adult migration were synchronous with reported dates for the Mackenzie Delta population that breeds along the northern coast of Northwest Territories, Canada, and stages in Atlantic Canada and for the Hudson Bay population that stages along the South Atlantic USA coast. However, the mean dates of juvenile photographs were 29-41 days later than adult dates, depending on the region. Space use by juveniles along the coast also differed from that reported for adults. Adults primarily depend on Atlantic Canada and the South Atlantic USA coast during fall migration. The percentage of juveniles was greater outside these two primary staging locations. Region-specific juvenile photograph dates suggest that juveniles may drift farther south than the majority of adults from their respective populations. The percentage of juvenile photos collected better predicted the percentage of adult photos 3 years later than 1 and 2 years later which is consistent with Whimbrel's delayed reproductive strategy and provides validation for using photographs to obtain age ratios. As photograph uploads become more commonplace, this and similar analyses may be used to obtain information that would normally be logistically difficult with traditional field methods.","[Hines, Chance; Duval, Laura; Watts, Bryan D.] William & Mary, Ctr Conservat Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Van Horn, Grant; Miller, Eliot] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Macaulay Lib, Ithaca, NY USA",Cornell University,"Hines, C (corresponding author), William & Mary, Ctr Conservat Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",chhines@wm.edu,NA,NA,National Fish and Wildlife Foundation [67046],National Fish and Wildlife Foundation,This project was made possible through a National Fish and Wildlife Foundation grant (#67046).

We estimated the climate-driven changes in the temperature niche compositions of bird communities inside and outside protected areas in southern Canada. We hypothesized that communities inside protected areas include a higher proportion of cold-dwelling species than communities outside protected areas. We also hypothesized that communities shift to warm-dwelling species more slowly inside protected areas than outside. To study community changes, we used large-scale and long-term (1997-2019) data from the Breeding Bird Survey of Canada. To describe the temperature niche compositions of bird communities, we calculated the community temperature index (CTI) annually for each community inside and outside protected areas. Generally, warm-dwelling species dominated communities with high CTI values. We modeled temporal changes in CTI as a function of protection status with linear mixed-effect models. We also determined which species contributed most to the temporal changes in CTI with a jackknife approach. As anticipated, CTI was lower inside protected areas than outside. However, contrary to our expectation, CTI increased faster over time inside than outside protected areas and warm-dwelling species contributed most to CTI change inside protected areas. These results highlight the ubiquitous impacts of climate warming. Currently, protected areas can aid cold-dwelling species by providing habitat, but as the climate warms, the communities' temperature compositions inside protected areas quickly begin to resemble those outside protected areas, suggesting that protected areas delay the impacts of climate warming on cold-dwelling species.","[Hintsanen, Leena; Marjakangas, Emma-Liina; Lehikoinen, Aleksi] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, POB 17, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Santangeli, Andrea] Univ Helsinki, Res Ctr Ecol Change, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol Res Programme, Helsinki, Finland; [Santangeli, Andrea] Univ Cape Town, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Cape Town, South Africa; [Johnston, Alison] Univ St Andrews, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, St Andrews, Scotland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Cape Town; National Research Foundation - South Africa; University of St Andrews,"Hintsanen, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, POB 17, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",leena.hintsanen@helsinki.fi,"Marjakangas, Emma-Liina/AAK-8254-2020; Santangeli, Andrea/HJJ-1458-2023; Johnston, Alison/N-4820-2016","Santangeli, Andrea/0000-0003-0273-1977; Johnston, Alison/0000-0001-8221-013X; Lehikoinen, Aleksi/0000-0002-1989-277X; Hintsanen, Leena/0000-0003-4684-8720","Academy of Finland [323527, 329251]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [329251] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We acknowledge all the volunteers and professionals involved in the BBS survey who made this research possible.

In order to examine the relative importance of stand attributes and geographical location we used Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) identified seven stand groups ranging from young stands to mature mixed woods to spruce-dominated stands and finally wet sites. CCA demonstrated that hardwood and softwood composition of stands, amount of jackpine, stand age, upland versus wetland classification, and geographic location of stands explained significant variation in bird species composition and abundance. Using partial CCA analysis, we partitioned out the total variation in the species matrix as follows: i) non-spatial environmental variation: 24%; ii) spatially structured environmental variation: 3%; iii) spatial species variation that is not shared by the environmental variables: 14%; and iv) unexplained variation and stochastic fluctuations: 59%. Stand variables explained 27% of the variation in the species matrix; however, the geographical component explained only one ninth of this variation. Thus, while geographical location contributed significantly to variation in the species matrix, its overall effect was small. Our results suggest that for several boreal forest birds, useful habitat or stand association models can be based on existing forest inventory and ecosystem site classification data.","Prairie & No Wildlife Res Ctr, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm Canada, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X4, Canada; Aquila Appl Ecol, Carlsbad Springs, ON K0A 1K0, Canada; Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; University of Saskatchewan,"Hobson, KA (corresponding author), Prairie & No Wildlife Res Ctr, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm Canada, 115 Perimeter Rd, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X4, Canada.",NA,"Smith, Amy/LIO-8314-2024; Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019; Kirk, David/AAA-7465-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,63,23,26,0,20,UNIVERSITE LAVAL,ST FOY,"PAVILLON ALEXANDRE-VACHON, UNIV LAVAL, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA",1195-6860,NA,NA,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,NA,7,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,267,280,NA,10.1080/11956860.2000.11682596,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2000.11682596,NA,NA,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,347CD,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000088908900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

A major purpose of CMMN is to detect population trends of migratory passerines that breed primarily in the boreal forest and are otherwise poorly monitored by the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). A primary limitation of this approach to monitoring is that it is currently not clear which geographic regions of the boreal forest are represented by the trends generated for each bird species at each station or group of stations. Such information on  catchment areas for CMMN will greatly enhance their value in contributing to understanding causes of population trends, as well as facilitating joint trend analysis for stations with similar catchments. It is now well established that naturally occurring concentrations of deuterium in feathers grown in North America can provide information on their approximate geographic origins, especially latitude. We used stable hydrogen isotope analyses of feathers (delta H-2(f)) from 15 species intercepted at 22 CMMN stations to assign approximate origins to populations moving through stations or groups of stations. We further constrained the potential catchment areas using prior information on potential longitudinal origins based upon bird migration trajectories predicted from band recovery data and known breeding distributions. We detected several cases of differences in catchment area of species passing through sites, and between seasons within species. We discuss the importance of our findings, and future directions for using this approach to assist conservation of migratory birds at continental scales.","[Hobson, Keith A.] Environm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0H3, Canada; [Van Wilgenburg, Steve L.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Hobson, Keith A.; Dunn, Erica H.] Environm Canada, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0H3, Canada; [Hussell, David J.

We anticipate that in response migrant semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) have adjusted migratory behavior, including a shift in stopover site usage toward locations offering greater safety from falcon predation. We assessed semipalmated sandpiper stopover usage within the Atlantic Canada Shorebird Survey dataset. Based on 3,030 surveys (totalling similar to 32M birds) made during southward migration, 1974-2017, at 198 stopover locations, we assessed the spatial distribution of site usage in each year (with a priority matching distribution index, PMD) in relation to the size (intertidal area) and safety (proportion of a site's intertidal area further than 150 m of the shoreline) of each location. The PMD index value is >1 when usage is concentrated at dangerous locations, 1.0 when usage matches location size, and <1 when usage is concentrated at safer locations. A large majority of migrants were found at the safest sites in all years, however our analysis of the PMD demonstrated that the fraction using safer sites increased over time. In 1974, 80% of birds were found at the safest 20% of the sites, while in 2017, this had increased to 97%. A sensitivity analysis shows that the shift was made specifically toward safer (and not just larger) sites. The shift as measured by a PMD index decline cannot be accounted for by possible biases inherent in the data set. We conclude that the data support the prediction that increasing predator danger has induced a shift by southbound migrant semipalmated sandpipers to safer sites.","[Hope, David D.; Lank, David B.; Ydenberg, Ronald C.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Smith, Paul A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Paquet, Julie] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Sackville, NB, Canada",Simon Fraser University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Hope, DD (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",david.hope@canada.ca,"Hope, David/K-7019-2012","Hope, David/0000-0002-2140-4261; Smith, Paul/0000-0001-9573-5218; Lank, David/0000-0002-2670-5143",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Graduate Fellowships from Simon Fraser University; Environment and Climate Change Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Graduate Fellowships from Simon Fraser University; Environment and Climate Change Canada,"This study was supported by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to RY, by Graduate Fellowships from Simon Fraser University to DH, and by contributions from Environment and Climate Change Canada to The Centre forWildlife Ecology at SFU.",NA,105,13,16,0,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,NA,NA,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Between autumn 2005 and winter 2008-2009, we recruited a non-random sample from the interested public though both print and electronic media. We had 1,291 individuals from 48 states (USA) and 7 Canadian provinces who completed our mail and website survey. Survey respondents were primarily female (67%) and >= 45 years old (77%). Most respondents offered alternative foods in addition to traditional bird seed (>= 82%) and provided other resources besides food to attract birds (>= 75%). Our respondents fed birds because it brought nature (84%) and accompanying sound (81%) to the area, as a hobby (79%), and to help the birds (79%). Respondents felt attracting more bird species (69%), a greater number of birds (41%), and no pests (35%) would make their bird-feeding experience more satisfying. Given the interested public's desire to increase bird diversity at their feeders and to help birds, managers have the opportunity to develop messages promoting habitat enhancement in addition to feeding, and provide suggestions for reducing the risk of disease transmission and pest species at feeders.

Eeyou land users from the Chisasibi and Wemindji First Nations report that their traditional fall goose hunt underwent a turning point during the early 2000s. Not only did the abundance of Canadian geese reach a historical low, but their feeding and migratory behavior became unpredictable. Eeyou land users associate such abrupt changes with the massive eelgrass die-off of the late 1990s, the onset of the effects of climate change on coastal habitats experienced since the 1970s, and agricultural development along geese flyways. This manuscript is an outcome of the Eeyou Knowledge component of the Coastal Habitat Comprehensive Research Project (2016-2022) and followed a community-based case study approach that included 28 semi-structured interviews and 14 mapping interviews with Eeyou research contributors. The findings presented here underscore the capacity of Indigenous knowledge to make sense of the multifaceted impacts of environmental change across various dimensions and layers of their social-ecological system, including management strategies and values.","[Idrobo, C.

These changes can involve a mis-timing between periods of high food demand and peak food availability, typically from advances in breeding phenology, and/or an overall reduction in food availability. Aerial insectivores, birds that feed on insects caught in flight, are experiencing steep population declines possibly because of shifts in the timing and/or abundance of aerial insects. We determined whether changes in breeding performance over time could account for declines in Bank Riparia riparia, Barn Hirundo rustica, Cliff Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, and Tree Tachycineta bicolor Swallows, and if so, whether changes were related to shifts in breeding phenology and/or climate change. We compared breeding performance and phenology in Maritime Canada before (1962-1972) and after (2006-2016) the onset of steep population declines during the mid-1980s, to determine whether breeding performance was reduced or phenology was advanced. Then, we modeled relationships between temperature, precipitation, breeding phenology, and performance for Barn and Tree Swallows, the only species with sufficient data, from 1960 to 2016, to determine whether phenology and performance were related to climatic conditions. Between the two time periods, we found significantly lower performance in Bank Swallows, higher performance in Barn and Tree Swallows, and unchanged performance in Cliff Swallows. We also found clutch initiation dates advanced by 8-10 d for all species except Bank Swallows. On the breeding grounds, warmer winter temperatures for Tree Swallows and less winter precipitation for Barn and Tree Swallows in a given year were associated with earlier breeding, and for Tree Swallows, changes in nestling survival. Otherwise, Barn and Tree Swallow breeding performance was unaffected by winter temperature and precipitation. Our results suggest that in this region poorer breeding performance could contribute to population declines for Bank Swallows but not for the other three species.","[Imlay, Tara L.; Saldanha, Sarah; Leonard, Marty L.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Flemming, Joanna Mills] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Wheelwright, Nathaniel T.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA",Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Bowdoin College,"Imlay, TL (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",tara.imlay@gmail.com,"Imlay, Tara/J-6599-2019; Flemming, Joanna/D-6323-2011; Saldanha, Sarah/ADX-1942-2022","Imlay, Tara/0000-0001-9011-3217; Mills Flemming, Joanna/0000-0002-3517-3089; Saldanha, Sarah/0000-0003-0084-1929",Canadian Wildlife Federation; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada; New Brunswick Wildlife Trust Fund; Nova Scotia Habitat Conservation Fund; Wildlife Preservation Canada,Canadian Wildlife Federation; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); New Brunswick Wildlife Trust Fund; Nova Scotia Habitat Conservation Fund; Wildlife Preservation Canada,"Many thanks to the field staff and volunteers involved in collecting and compiling data on swallow breeding phenology and performance (in alphabetical order): E.

Documenting outbreak patterns and determining the ecological drivers of transmission risk are fundamental to predicting disease spread and assessing potential impacts on population viability. However, evaluating disease in wildlife populations requires expansive surveillance networks that often do not exist in remote and developing areas. Here, we describe the results of a community-based research initiative conducted in collaboration with indigenous harvesters, the Inuit, in response to a new series of Avian Cholera outbreaks affecting Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) and other comingling species in the Canadian Arctic. Avian Cholera is a virulent disease of birds caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida. Common Eiders are a valuable subsistence resource for Inuit, who hunt the birds for meat and visit breeding colonies during the summer to collect eggs and feather down for use in clothing and blankets. We compiled the observations of harvesters about the growing epidemic and with their assistance undertook field investigation of 131 colonies distributed over > 1200 km of coastline in the affected region. Thirteen locations were identified where Avian Cholera outbreaks have occurred since 2004. Mortality rates ranged from 1% to 43% of the local breeding population at these locations. Using a species-habitat model (Maxent), we determined that the distribution of outbreak events has not been random within the study area and that colony size, vegetation cover, and a measure of host crowding in shared wetlands were significantly correlated to outbreak risk. In addition, outbreak locations have been spatially structured with respect to hypothesized introduction foci and clustered along the migration corridor linking Arctic breeding areas with wintering areas in Atlantic Canada. At present, Avian Cholera remains a localized threat to Common Eider populations in the Arctic; however expanded, community-based surveillance will be required to track disease spread.","[Iverson, Samuel A.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Iverson, Samuel A.] Canadian Wildlife Serv Environm & Climate Change, Sackville, NB, Canada; [Forbes, Mark R.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Simard, Manon] Makivik Corp, Nunavik Res Ctr, Kuujjuaq, PQ, Canada; [Soos, Catherine] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Soos, Catherine] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Vet Pathol, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Gilchrist, H.

Opportunistic citizen science observations submitted by hikers in remote alpine regions can be valuable, as coverage can be extensive compared to scientific field surveys. Here, we compare the performance of two regression and three machine learning statistical modeling approaches and an ensemble model to predict the distribution of the Vancouver Island subspecies of White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura saxatilis) based on two datasets: (1) field survey observations from radio-telemetry and call-playbacks, and (2) opportunistic citizen science observations submitted by hikers. Predictions of suitable habitat for the Vancouver Island subspecies varied from 370 to 1039 km(2) based on field survey observations and from 404 to 1354 km(2) based on public observations. All models had fair accuracy (kappa > 0.45) when tested on an independent dataset, but Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models tended to over-predict ptarmigan occurrence, had the lowest accuracy, and were most sensitive to the type of response data used. All the machine learning modeling techniques differed little between the datasets. These comparable results are encouraging for the continued use of citizen science monitoring programs, which can save both time and expense while involving and educating the public about threatened species. We advocate the use of opportunistic citizen science data and machine learning modeling techniques (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, and Maxent) for predicting alpine vertebrate species distributions.

Differences attributable to the accumulation of species with increasing area are ignored, differences in the density of individuals are often masked by other factors, and many combinations of species richness and relative abundance can produce the same value of the index. Alternatively, comparing species richness by standardizing samples either to equal numbers of individuals or to the number of individuals expected on equal-sized plots, and expressing the relative abundance of species as a graph of their relative abundances arranged in a decreasing array are suggested. An analysis of bird census data based on the proposed methods is presented. Comparisons with applications of 4 indices commonly used in ecology, the Shannon-Weaver index of diversity, the J'' evenness index, the inverse of Simpson''s measure of concentration and Hill''s evenness index, are included. For 37 breeding bird censuses taken in various terrestrial habitats across the USA and Canada, the proposed methods reveal some very general relationships about the organization of bird communities in different habitats. Equal-sized areas of mature deciduous forest and 2nd-growth habitats may be equally species-rich (14-24 spp. with .gtoreq. 1 breeding territory/6 ha); the density of individuals (territorial pairs) is generally higher in deciduous forest habitats, and the relative abundance of bird species shows more dominance (less evenness) in the deciduous forest. Mixed coniferous-deciduous forests and dense young deciduous forests have fewer species than mature eastern deciduous forests or 2nd-growth habitats (9-16 and 7-10 spp./6 ha, respectively); however, the density of individuals is approximately equal to that in 2nd-growth habitats. Coniferous forests are species-poor (5-8/6 ha), and the density of territorial pairs is low (8-12/6 ha compared with 40-70 in deciduous forests). Although the proposed methods require assumptions that must be evaluated carefully, they probably will have other useful applications in the analysis of avian communities.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA; TALL TIMBERS RES STN, TALLAHASSE, FL 32312 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,75,241,266,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,1938-4254,NA,AUK,AUK,NA,98,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,785,800,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,MR374,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:A1981MR37400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding how much people benefit from local bird populations levels, species richness and their preferences can help inform bird conservation management. This paper uses eBird data and random utility models to assess the birders' preferences and welfare for trips to local areas. The sample eBird citizen science data includes 35,656 trips by 290 individual birders to 1227 unique birding hotspots in Alberta, Canada. The economic value of seeing one additional bird species during a trip is estimated to be $0.68 on average. We estimated a nonlinear relationship between the utility and number of bird species suggesting satiation in recreation preferences, and the highest MWTP is estimated to be in the summer and fall seasons. Bird species at risk, based on Alberta's strategy for the management of species at risk, are valued almost ten times higher as seeing other types of bird species. We also estimate individualized choice models and find that preference for species richness is heterogeneous across birders. Results of a combinatorial test find that the individualized choice models produce average welfare estimates that are 67% higher than the single model but the difference is not statistically significant. The members of eBird represent a convenience sample that may not constitute the general population. Thus along with proper weighting, these benefit estimates produced in this research can help inform future bird conservation management decisions including alternative funding mechanisms.","[Jayalath, Tharaka A.

Conversion of natural habitats to human use can affect the abundance and distribution of predators and parasites, create population sinks, and reduce the viability of valued prey and host species. We asked how the distribution of brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater, a generalist brood parasite, has influenced the source-sink dynamics of song sparrow Melospiza melodia populations and their regional population trends. 2. We intensively studied 17 host populations subject to varying levels of parasitism for 1-36 years. We linked these data to spatial and demographic models to predict growth rate in song sparrow populations in the Southern Gulf Islands, BC, Canada. 3. Patterns of growth in song sparrow populations were closely related to cowbird distribution, which in turn depended on land use patterns at landscape scales. Locally, sparrow populations were expected to increase in areas far from cowbird feeding areas, where parasitism was low, but to decline where parasitism exceeded 20%. The predicted population trends were similar to those recorded locally and via the North American Breeding Bird Survey. 4. Synthesis and applications. We show that the distribution of habitats favourable to brood parasites can affect whether host populations grow or decline regionally. In highly sedentary hosts like the sparrows in this study, density-dependent juvenile dispersal and marked spatial variation in the probability of parasitism can give rise to source-and-sink dynamics. Our results illustrate how the application of spatial models and empirical data can predict how land use decisions may influence host dynamics. We identify ways in which applied ecologists might influence land use to enhance the persistence of valued hosts, and suggest that our approach provides a promising framework for exploring regional-scale spatial dynamics of species in order to identify critical habitat and prioritize investments in conservation.","[Jewell, Kelly J.; Arcese, Peter] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Jewell, KJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, 3041-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",kellyislands@yahoo.com,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,61,16,20,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,NA,J APPL ECOL,J.

Based on the crops grown at these stops in 1992, four types of agricultural landscapes were identified: cash crops, forage crops and pastureland, crops and livestock raising, and heterogeneous landscape. An intensive bird census of these stops in June 1992 showed that species richness and abundance are greater at stops with a heterogeneous landscape than at those characterized mainly by cash crops, Cash crops (corn, wheat soybean) now cover more surface area than in the 1960s, whereas numerous dairy farms have disappeared over the past 25 years because of abandonment, urbanization and industrialization. These changes in the crops grown in the most productive agricultural regions of Quebec appear to be responsible for fluctuations in populations of a number of farmland species in the St. Lawrence Lowland. Many species associated with dairy farming, such as the Savannah Sparrow, Bobolink, Brown-headed Cowbird and Eastern Meadowlark, show decreasing population abundance, while other species such as the Ring-billed Gull and Rock Dove appear to be benefiting from the introduction of intensive agriculture.","ENVIRONM CANADA,CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV,QUEBEC CITY,PQ G1V 4H5,CANADA; GAUTHIER & GUILLEMETTE CONSULTANTS INC,ST ROMUALD,PQ G6W 3L8,CANADA; ENVIRONM CANADA,CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV,NATL WILDLIFE RES CTR,HULL,PQ K1A 0H3,CANADA",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,43,35,51,3,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,NA,NA,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

A species-specific standardized survey protocol for Least Bitterns was developed to increase detection, quantify detection probability and improve knowledge of the species' distribution, abundance and habitat use. The protocol is a modification of the Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol (Conway 2009), whereby only the Least Bittern call is broadcast repeatedly at fixed point count survey stations, and a second passive listening period is added after the broadcast period to increase detection. Vocalizations and behavior are noted on a minute-by-minute basis for each individual Least Bittern, along with estimated distance at first detection. The protocol has been implemented in Canada since 2006 and has resulted in Least Bitterns being detected in more sites and larger numbers than previously suspected. Adoption of the proposed protocol is recommended across the Least Bittern range when Least Bittern detection is the focus of a survey or monitoring program; therefore allowing direct comparisons of relative abundance and detection probabilities amongst sites.

In a previous study, we determined that local-scale (< 15km) spatial synchrony of bird populations in New England was correlated with synchronous fluctuations in lepidopteran larvae abundance and with the North Atlantic Oscillation. Here we address five questions that extend the scope of our earlier study using North American Breeding Bird Survey data. First, do bird populations in eastern North America exhibit spatial synchrony in abundances at scales beyond those we have documented previously? Second, does spatial synchrony depend on what population metric is analyzed ( e. g., abundance, growth rate, or variability)? Third, is there geographic concordance in where species exhibit synchrony? Fourth, for those species that exhibit significant geographic concordance, are there landscape and habitat variables that contribute to the observed patterns? Fifth, is spatial synchrony affected by a species' life history traits? Significant spatial synchrony was common and its magnitude was dependent on the population metric analyzed. Twenty-four of 29 species examined exhibited significant synchrony in population abundance: mean local autocorrelation (rho) = 0.15; mean spatial extent ( mean distance where rho = 0) = 420.7 km. Five of the 29 species exhibited significant synchrony in annual population growth rate ( mean local autocorrelation 0.06, mean distance 457.8 km). Ten of the 29 species exhibited significant synchrony in population abundance variability ( mean local autocorrelation 0.49, mean distance 413.8 km). Analyses of landscape structure indicated that habitat variables were infrequent contributors to spatial synchrony. Likewise, we detected no effects of life history traits on synchrony in population abundance or growth rate. However, short-distance migrants exhibited more spatially extensive synchrony in population variability than either year-round residents or long-distance migrants. The dissimilarity of the spatial extent of synchrony across species suggests that most populations are not regulated at similar spatial scales. The spatial scale of the population synchrony patterns we describe is likely larger than the actual scale of population regulation, and in turn, the scale of population regulation is undoubtedly larger than the scale of individual ecological requirements.","Vassar Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 12604 USA; Nature Conservancy, Lansing, MI 48906 USA; Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03748 USA",Vassar College; Nature Conservancy; Dartmouth College,"Jones, J (corresponding author), Vassar Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 12604 USA.",jajones@vassar.edu,NA,NA,Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1010223] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),NA,NA,36,19,20,1,41,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,NA,NA,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,88,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,2505,2515,NA,10.1890/06-1514.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1514.1,NA,NA,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,228FY,18027754,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000250714200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This approach omits a large amount of ecological information as landscapes are best described as mosaics in watersheds. Species Accumulation Curves (SACs) that incorporate sampling effort are familiar models of how biodiversity will change when landcovers are lost. In land-based systems, the consistent pattern of increased species richness with increasing number of sites sampled is an ecological norm. In freshwater systems, fish species discharge relationships are analogous to species-area relationships in terrestrial systems, but the relationship between terrestrial species and discharge remains largely unexplored. Although some studies investigate the effect of terrestrial systems on neighboring aquatic species, less work has been done on exploring the effect of aquatic systems on terrestrial species. Additionally, creating statistical models to observe these interactions need to be explored further. Using data from the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (2001-2005), we created bird SACs to explore how increases in diversity with sites sampled varies with watershed position on the Canadian side of the Great Lakes Basin (GLB). The mosaic landscape of the GLB was characterized using six majority land cover classes at a 15 m resolution. This work shows that rates of species accrual and potential maximum species richness vary as a function of watershed position, underlying land cover, and the Ecoregion in which sampling was performed. We also found that Urban landcover has the potential to retain relatively high levels of species richness, which is further modified by Ecoregion and watershed position. Through our 'world building,' we believe that we can increase knowledge around the importance of land-water interactions and further the goals of viewing landscapes as mosaic watersheds.","[Julien, Adisa] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Chem & Biol, Melles Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Melles, Stephanie] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Urban Water Res Ctr, Dept Chem & Biol, Melles Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Julien, A (corresponding author), Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Chem & Biol, Melles Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada.",adisa.julien@ryerson.ca,"Melles, Stephanie/AAH-1507-2020","Melles, Stephanie/0000-0002-2983-8136",Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) Black Graduate Student Scholarship; TMU Graduate Scholarships; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [DG 03834-2015],Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) Black Graduate Student Scholarship; TMU Graduate Scholarships; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),We gratefully acknowledge a Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) Black Graduate Student Scholarship and several TMU Graduate Scholarships to AJ.

However, this is a challenging undertaking given the complex hierarchical nature of the processes involved in avian habitat selection and also given the selection of data scales (resolution and extents) available in satellite-derived land cover. Past research has largely neglected to consider how grain size limitations are related to species' functional traits. Fortunately, with the increased ubiquity of available land cover maps and open-access datasets detailing avian functional traits, tackling these questions is becoming more feasible. Using data from the Ontario Land Cover Compilation v2, the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (2001-2005), and functional trait data from the AVONET dataset, we trained Random Forest models to predict scale-dependent land cover preferences based on avian functional traits. To capture changing scales, we used increasing pixel sizes from the land cover map of our study area which sought to replicate the different perceptual ranges of avian species. Our Random Forest models showcase the ability to accurately predict between natural and human-modified land cover with varying predictive accuracies. Notably, we observed heightened accuracy at smaller pixel sizes, with a subtle decline as grain size increased. By revealing the relationship between avian traits and habitat selection across multiple scales, our study advances our understanding of species-environment interactions, offering valuable insights for conservation strategies and a deeper understanding of avian habitat selection.","[Julien, Adisa; Melles, Stephanie] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Chem & Biol, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Melles, Stephanie] Urban Water TMU, Toronto, ON M5B 1G3, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"Melles, S (corresponding author), Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Chem & Biol, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.;Melles, S (corresponding author), Urban Water TMU, Toronto, ON M5B 1G3, Canada.",adisa.julien@torontomu.ca; stephanie.melles@torontomu.ca,"Melles, Stephanie/AAH-1507-2020","Melles, Stephanie/0000-0002-2983-8136","Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) Black Graduate Student Scholarship; TMU Graduate Scholarships; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [DG 03834-2015, DG 04982-2023]",Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) Black Graduate Student Scholarship; TMU Graduate Scholarships; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),We gratefully acknowledge a Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) Black Graduate Student Scholarship and several TMU Graduate Scholarships to AJ.

Using coefficient of variation (CV) as a metric, we provide recommendations for number of years a station should be operated and numbers of captures and between-year recaptures required to achieve acceptable levels of precision for adult survival estimation. Our primary aim was to provide minimum sample-size guidelines for MAPS banding station operators. The proportion of individual species x spatial scale scenarios for which we could obtain adult survival estimates, as well as the precision of those estimates, increased substantially once six years of data were collected, and we recommend six years as a target minimum level of continuity for banding station operation. Across 33 species analyzed, averages of 23.4 captures (3.9/yr) and 2.1 recaptures (0.4/yr) were needed to yield marginally precise survival estimates (CV of 20% to 30%, inclusive), while averages of 89.2 captures (14.9/yr) and 6.3 recaptures (1.1/yr) were needed to achieve more precise estimates (CV < 20%). We suggest these as guidelines for minimum capture and recapture rates at the scale of individual banding stations and for clusters of stations, e.g., multiple stations operated in a selected habitat type or sampling region, respectively. It should be noted, however, that sample-size requirements will vary markedly among species. For example, reliable estimates of survival for species with low between-year site fidelity, e.g., Tennessee Warbler (Leiothlypis peregrina), will not be obtainable at any sample size; while species with high inter-annual site fidelity and recapture probabilities, e.g., some flycatchers, thrushes, sparrows, and wood warblers, will require smaller sample sizes than those proposed here as guidelines.","[Kaschube, Danielle R.; Saracco, James F.; Ray, Chris; Pyle, Peter] Inst Bird Populat, Point Reyes Stn, CA 94956 USA; [Godwin, Christine M.; Foster, Kenneth R.] Owl Moon Environm Inc, Ft Mcmurray, AB, Canada",NA,"Kaschube, DR (corresponding author), Inst Bird Populat, Point Reyes Stn, CA 94956 USA.",NA,"Saracco, James/H-6520-2019; Ray, Chris/AAI-1002-2019","Saracco, James/0000-0001-5084-1834",Syncrude Canada Ltd.; Hammerstone Infrastructure Materials Ltd.; Canadian Natural Resources Limited; Cenovus Energy; ConocoPhillips Canada Resources Corp.; Devon Energy; Husky Oil Operations Ltd.; Imperial Oil Ltd.; Suncor Energy Inc.; TOTAL EP Canada; CNOOC International; Oil Sands Developers Group; Oil Sands Monitoring Program,Syncrude Canada Ltd.; Hammerstone Infrastructure Materials Ltd.; Canadian Natural Resources Limited; Cenovus Energy; ConocoPhillips Canada Resources Corp.; Devon Energy; Husky Oil Operations Ltd.; Imperial Oil Ltd.; Suncor Energy Inc.; TOTAL EP Canada; CNOOC International; Oil Sands Developers Group; Oil Sands Monitoring Program,"The substantive support provided by our sponsors is acknowledged with gratitude, and the dedication of all involved to ensuring that this program meets a high level of independent scientific rigor is very much appreciated.

Owl abundance fluctuated from year to year, but fluctuations were not synchronous among count localities across the Great Plains. Owls first appeared on our study sites in southwestern Alberta [Canada] in early November and individuals continued to arrive until late December of early January. Spring departure occurred during late February and early March, with a few owls remaining until late March. During midwinter, the mean number of owls censused on four study sites ranged from 1.3 to 5.8 owls/100 km in 1983.sbd.1984 and from 1.7 to 10.2 owls/100 km in 1984.sbd.1985.

In Saskatchewan, more species of Neotropical migrants decreased (16) than increased (9; P > 0.05 < 0.1). Combined densities of Neotropical migrants declined (14-44%) on all of the Saskatchewan plots; Tennessee Warblers (Vermivora peregrina), Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus), and Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) declined on the most plots and by the greatest magnitude and Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) and Rose-breasted Grosbeaks (Pheucticus ludovicianus) also decreased. Six of seven Neotropical migrants showed the same direction of change as in a province-wide Breeding Bird Survey. Successional changes did not account for decreased densities of these five species, but they may partly explain increases in some other species. Fluctuations in food supply (e.g., spruce budworm [Choristoneura fumiferana]) could not explain changes, because some species that should have responded numerically to budworm outbreaks that occurred in the 1990s had increased whereas others had decreased at the same site. The surrounding forest remained continuous over the 17-18 years, so changes in forest area cannot account for the declines. In Manitoba, more Neotropical migrants increased (19) than decreased (11) according to combined densities from four plots. Combined densities of Neotropical migrants also increased at three of the four plots (33-123%). Ten of 15 Neotropical migrant species showed different 'trends' than a province-wide analysis of BBS data. All changes in Manitoba could be attributed to vegetation succession on the plots and forest fragmentation in surrounding landscapes. Trends in Saskatchewan may be representative of general declines within continuously forested boreal landscapes, whereas those in Manitoba may reflect reduced opportunities for breeding in continuous forest as the landscape is increasingly fragmented by agriculture.","CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV, NATL WILDLIFE RES CTR, HULL, PQ K1A 0H3, CANADA; UNIV NEW BRUNSWICK, ATLANTIC COOPERAT WILDLIFE ECOL RES NETWORK, FREDERICTON, NB E3B 6E1, CANADA; PRAIRIE & NO WILDLIFE RES CTR, ENVIRONM CANADA, CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV, SASKATOON, SK S7N 0X4, CANADA",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; University of New Brunswick; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"AQUILA APPL ECOLOGISTS, CP 47, WAKEFIELD, PQ J0X 3G0, CANADA.",NA,"Kirk, David/AAA-7465-2021; Smith, Amy/LIO-8314-2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,58,12,13,0,12,WILSON ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,WACO,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710 USA",0043-5643,NA,NA,WILSON BULL,Wilson Bull.,MAR,109,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,WP229,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:A1997WP22900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

According to the primary sources reviewed, many raptor populations increased since the early 1970s, coinciding with reductions in use of organochlorine pesticides (OCs). Species that increased included osprey Pandion haliaetus, bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus (BBS and CBC) and peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus anatum (1995 peregrine falcon survey). Red-tailed hawk Buteo jamaicensis, American kestrel Falco sparverius and merlin Falco columbarius also generally increased or were stable, but results differed according to source, time period and ecozone (both red-tailed hawk and American kestrel showed short-term decreases in the Mixedwood Plains BBS). Significant declines were found for burrowing owl Speotyto cunicularia (BBS), short-eared owl Asio flammeus and long-eared owl Asio otus populations (BBS and CBC). Golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos may be declining in some areas (CBC, four migration counts) but results were equivocal; there was some evidence to suggest that broad-winged hawk Buteo platypterus may also be declining. Long-term BBS data indicated that Swainson's hawk Buteo swainsoni populations were stable, but significant short-term declines were found in the Prairies ecozone, corresponding with decreases in productivity measured in long-term breeding studies. Sharp-shinned hawk Accipiter striatus apparently increased in number according to the overall long-term BBS, but may be declining according to some eastern migration count data. While no evidence of declines was found for prairie falcon Falco mexicanus, the Canadian population is small and vulnerable to habitat change that could reduce prey populations. Four species that reach their greatest abundance in, or are restricted to, the Prairies and Boreal Plains ecozones are declining there (northern harrier Circus cyaneus, Swainson's hawk, burrowing owl and short-eared owl). Although causal factors vary, our analysis suggests the possibility that large-scale phenomena such as human activity (pesticide use or habitat modification) and perhaps climate are affecting populations of some Prairie raptors. Research on endangered species is being conducted under the auspices of national recovery plans. We recommend that research be instigated to examine critically productivity failures in Swainson's hawks, and possible declines in golden eagle breeding populations. In view, of the increasingly wide-spread impact of forestry on northern forests in Canada, we further recommend that special surveys be set lip, and breeding densities, productivity and occupancy rates be determined in different forest types for accipiters, broad-winged hawk, as well as forest owls (particularly barren owl Strix varia, boreal owl Aegolius funereus and northern saw-whet owl Aegolius acadicus brooksi). We caution that the BBS and other national surveys may be inadequate for monitoring populations of many raptor species in Canada, particularly forest-dwelling accipiters, some owls and buteos. Special monitoring or sampling programs are needed for these species. However, taken together, multiple sources can provide inferential evidence for population trends and status.

According to the primary sources reviewed, many raptor populations increased since the early 1970s, coinciding with reductions in use of organochlorine pesticides (OCs). Species that increased included osprey Pandion haliaetus, bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus (BBS and CBC) and peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus anatum (1995 peregrine falcon survey). Red-tailed hawk Buteo jamaicensis, American kestrel Falco sparverius and merlin Falco columbarius also generally increased or were stable, but results differed according to source, time period and ecozone (both red-tailed hawk and American kestrel showed short-term decreases in the Mixedwood Plains BBS). Significant declines were found for burrowing owl Speotyto cunicularia (BBS), short-eared owl Asio flammeus and long-eared owl Asio otus populations (BBS and CBC). Golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos may be declining in some areas (CBC, four migration counts) but results were equivocal; there was some evidence to suggest that broad-winged hawk Buteo platypterus may also be declining. Long-term BBS data indicated that Swainson's hawk Buteo swainsoni populations were stable, but significant short-term declines were found in the Prairies ecozone, corresponding with decreases in productivity measured in long-term breeding studies. Sharp-shinned hawk Accipiter striatus apparently increased in number according to the overall long-term BBS, but may be declining according to some eastern migration count data. While no evidence of declines was found for prairie falcon Falco mexicanus, the Canadian population is small and vulnerable to habitat change that could reduce prey populations. Four species that reach their greatest abundance in, or are restricted to, the Prairies and Boreal Plains ecozones are declining there (northern harrier Circus cyaneus, Swainson's hawk, burrowing owl and short-eared owl). Although causal factors vary, our analysis suggests the possibility that large-scale phenomena such as human activity (pesticide use or habitat modification) and perhaps climate are affecting populations of some Prairie raptors.

Here we present a hierarchical framework to identify a suite of farmland bird species in Ontario, Canada by consolidating and validating classifications derived from literature review and empirical modelling. First, we reviewed literature to compile candidate farmland bird species in Ontario and assigned species to four guilds (row crop specialists, pasture specialists, farmstead specialists, and farmland edge generalists). Second, we used regression trees (RTs) to test whether these species could be classified into the same literature-based guilds or different guilds, based on modelled relationships between breeding bird atlas abundance data and Census of Agriculture statistics. We consolidated both classifications using a decision tree into a final list of 45 farmland bird species, comprising 11 farmstead specialists, 13 pasture specialists, 5 row crop specialists, 12 farmland edge generalists, and 4 farmland generalists flagged for classification uncertainty. To validate the distinctness of the assigned farmland bird guilds, we used pairwise permANOVA to test for differences in species composition among guilds, based on 34 species with sufficient occurrence data. We found significant compositional differences between almost all guilds, except for the farmstead specialist and row crop specialist guilds which could not be differentiated. We also validated species' guild assignments using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) to group 35 species according to ecological resemblance which were then compared to our proposed guild classifications. CAP validated guild assignments for 78.2% of the evaluated farmland specialists, particularly for farmstead specialists and pasture specialists, while 50% of evaluated farmland edge generalists were grouped differently than our final classification. Each final classification was associated with low, moderate, or high uncertainty according to concordance between classification methods and support from CAP groupings to highlight species with uncertainly assigned guilds. For some such species, mismatches between their literature-based and empirically-derived classifications might be due to the predictor variables being measured at too large a scale to reflect associations between their abundance distributions and agricultural landscape characteristics. We recommend that these farmland bird species be further verified using statistical models of bird count data, satellite imagery, and climate variables, and a trait-based approach to bolster confidence in the proposed list. When confirmed and expanded, this list can be used to inform a farmland bird indicator to monitor agroecosystem health in Ontario, and perhaps elsewhere in eastern North America.","[Kirk, David Anthony] Aquila Conservat & Environm Consulting, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hebert, Katherine] Univ Sherbrooke, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Lindsay, Kathryn Freemark] Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Environm & Climate Change Canada, S&T Wildlife & Landscape Sci Directorate, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lindsay, Kathryn Freemark; Kreuzberg, Elena] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Sherbrooke; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Carleton University,"Kirk, DA (corresponding author), Aquila Conservat & Environm Consulting, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",david@aquilaecology.com,"Kirk, David/AAA-7465-2021","Hebert, Katherine/0000-0001-7866-6775; KIRK, DAVID ANTHONY/0000-0002-3080-1058","Environment and Climate Change Canada (National Wildlife Research Centre, Canada) [K8A31-12-0037]; FRQNT doctoral research scholarship (Quebec, Canada); Carleton University, (Ontario, Canada)","Environment and Climate Change Canada (National Wildlife Research Centre, Canada); FRQNT doctoral research scholarship (Quebec, Canada); Carleton University, (Ontario, Canada)","This study is based on a Master's degree completed by E.

A total of 15 species was analyzed, including several largely insectivorous boreal species. Interspecific synchrony was common, with 34 species pairs (32% of a possible 105) statistically synchronous across all or part of North America and clusters of up to five species exhibiting significant synchrony in all pairwise combinations. Within species synchrony was significant between eastern and western North America for five species. The relationship between interspecific synchrony and diet was weak and significantly higher among species in the same diet category in western North America only. Periodicity as measured by temporal autocorrelations in mean winter density at lags of up to three,years was significant for eight of the species in at least one of the geographic regions; four of these (Red-breasted Nuthatch [Sitta canadensis], Red Crossbill [Loxia curvirostra], Common Redpoll [Carduelis flammea], and Pine Siskin [Spinus pinus]) exhibited a significant pattern of alternating cycles of low and high densities in at least one of the geographic regions analyzed. These results confirm that eruptions of boreal seed-eating birds are sometimes interspecifically synchronous events. However, the weak relationship with diet supports the hypothesis that factors in addition to food play an important role in both causing and synchronizing eruptions. Furthermore, synchrony varies dramatically through time, and thus conclusions regarding both the patterns and causes of eruptions are likely to differ depending on the time frame considered.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Hastings Reservat, Carmel Valley, CA 93924 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Carmel Valley, CA 93924 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Hastings Reservat, 38601 E Carmel Valley Rd, Carmel Valley, CA 93924 USA.",wicker@uclink4.berkeley.edu,"Koenig, Walter/A-5509-2009","Koenig, Walter/0000-0001-6207-1427",NA,NA,NA,NA,28,35,46,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,NA,CONDOR,Condor,NOV,103,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,725,735,NA,10.1650/0010-5422(2001)103[0725:SAPOEB]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/0010-5422(2001)103[0725:SAPOEB]2.0.CO;2,NA,NA,11,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,491XM,NA,Bronze,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000172135400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used data from Project FeederWatch, a citizen science program focused on winter bird populations, to quantify the effects of EAB invasion on four species of resident, insectivorous birds known or likely to be EAB predators: three woodpecker species and the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis). We compared relative numbers of birds within 50 km of the epicenter of the region where EAB was first detected, an area known to have suffered high ash tree mortality by 2008, to numbers 50-100 km from the epicenter and to control sites within 50 km of five comparable Midwestern cities where damage due to EAB has yet to be severe. We found evidence for significant effects on all four of the species in response to the EAB invasion in the highly impacted region, with red-bellied woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) and white-breasted nuthatches showing numerical increases while downy woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens) and hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) initially declined but exhibited at least temporary increases several years later. Temporal correlation analyses failed to provide support for immigration being a major cause of the elevated numbers in the highly impacted area, and thus these results are consistent with the hypothesis that increases were due to enhanced survival and/or reproduction associated with the EAB invasion within the highly impacted area. Results suggest that the continuing invasion of EAB into new areas is likely to significantly alter avian communities, although not always in ways that will be easy to predict.","[Koenig, Walter D.; Bonter, David N.; Hochachka, Wesley M.; Dickinson, Janis L.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Koenig, Walter D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Liebhold, Andrew M.] US Forest Serv, USDA, No Res Stn, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Dickinson, Janis L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Cornell University,"Koenig, WD (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",wdk4@cornell.edu,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008; Koenig, Walter/A-5509-2009; Hochachka, Wesley/J-9768-2012; Bonter, David/H-1313-2013","Koenig, Walter/0000-0001-6207-1427; Hochachka, Wesley/0000-0002-0595-7827; Bonter, David/0000-0003-1768-1941",NSF [IOS-0918944],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank Project FeederWatch participants and donors for their continuing support and the reviewers for their comments.

Willow Flycatchers were restricted to the Foothills and Rocky Mountains regions ranging from Water-ton Lakes National Park north to Jasper National Park. In Alberta, Willow Flycatchers showed a preference for wet riparian areas, many of which also supported Alder Flycatchers (Empidonax alnorum).

The actual number is difficult to ascertain. Previous attempts to estimate bird-window collision rates in Canada relied heavily on a prior citizen-science study that used memory-based surveys. Such an approach to data collection has many potential biases. We built upon this study and its recommendations for future research by creating a citizen-science program that actively searched for collision evidence at houses and apartments for an extended period with the objective to see how standardized approaches to data collection compared with memory recall. Absolute collision estimates as well as relative differences were compared between residence types in the two studies, and we found considerable differences in absolute values for collisions but similar rankings of collision rates between residence types. Collision recall rates in our study (56.5%) were very similar those in the prior 2012 study, where 50.5% of participants remembered a bird colliding with a window at some time in the past. Fatality estimates, however, were 1.4 times higher in the 2012 study than in our study based on standardized searches. Rural houses with a bird feeder consistently had the highest number of collisions. This suggests that memory recall surveys may be a useful tool for understanding the relative importance of different risk factors causing bird-window collisions.","[Kummer, Justine A.; Bayne, Erin M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, CW 405 Biol Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Machtans, Craig S.] Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Sackville, NB, Canada",University of Alberta; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Kummer, JA (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, CW 405 Biol Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",kummer@ualberta.ca,"Bayne, Erin/IUP-1777-2023","Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521",Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta and Environment Canada,Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta and Environment Canada,"We want to thank the 1315 homeowners who registered and participated in the Birds and Windows project.

Only two studies have examined carcass removal by scavengers in an urban environment, and previous estimates of bird-window collision mortality at houses have relied on carcass removal rates from wind turbine studies. We placed a bird carcass and time-lapse camera at 44 houses in Edmonton, Alberta. In total, 166 7-day trials were conducted throughout 2015. Time-to-event (survival) analysis was used to identify covariates that affected removal. The carcass removal rate was determined for use in estimating the number of birds killed from bird-window collisions at houses in Alberta. In total, 67.5% of carcasses were removed. The date the carcass was placed, the year the house was built, and the level of development within 50 m of the house were the covariates that had the largest effect on carcass removal. In calculating our removal rate, the number of detected carcasses in the first 24 hours was adjusted by 1.47 to account for removal by scavengers. Previously collected citizen science data were used to create an estimate of 957,440 bird deaths each year in Alberta as a result of bird-window collisions with houses. This number is based on the most detailed bird-window collision study at houses to date and a carcass removal study conducted in the same area. Similar localized studies across Canada will need to be completed to reduce the biases that exist with the previous bird-window collision mortality estimate for houses in Canada.","[Kummer, Justine A.; Nordell, Cameron J.; Berry, Taylor M.; Collins, Colina V.; Tse, Casandra R.

We assessed how neighborhood type, yard conditions, house attributes, and window type influenced collision rates. Data were collected from citizen scientists across Alberta, Canada, who surveyed their houses daily. In relation to the best-fitting model, the yard model explained 58.1% of the explained deviance, the neighborhood model 45.6%, and the house model 42.6%. The factors that had the largest effect for predicting collision risk included season and whether the house was in a rural or an urban area (rural areas in the fall had a 6.0x higher collision risk than urban areas in the winter), the height of vegetation in the front yard of the house (trees >2 stories high increased collision risk by 3.6x compared to houses with no trees), and the presence of a bird feeder (which increased collision risk by 1.73). This suggests that multiple factors affect collision rates and that the suitability of a yard as bird habitat is likely a key driver. Given that few homeowners are likely to take an approach that reduces the number of birds in their yards, future focus needs to be given to bird-friendly urban design and developing the most effective window deterrents so that collisions can be reduced and birds enjoyed in urban environments.","[Kummer, Justine A.; Bayne, Erin M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Machtans, Craig S.] Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Whitehorse, YT, Canada",University of Alberta; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Kummer, JA (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",kummer@ualberta.ca,"Bayne, Erin/IUP-1777-2023","Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521",Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta; Environment Canada,Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta(University of Alberta); Environment Canada(CGIAR),The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta and Environment Canada provided funding for the project.,NA,33,31,40,5,83,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,1938-5129,NA,CONDOR,Condor,AUG,118,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,624,639,NA,10.1650/CONDOR-16-26.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-16-26.1,NA,NA,16,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,DV7BN,NA,"Green Submitted, Bronze",NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000383091000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Location The contiguous United States and southern Canada. Methods We used 1673 North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes containing 547 terrestrial and aquatic species to estimate four diversity components: species richness, individual abundance, taxonomic distinctness and species evenness. We implemented three levels of analysis to examine changes in diversity structure on a yearly basis from 1968 to 2003: (1) a canonical analysis of discriminance, (2) a univariate analysis across BBS routes, and (3) a univariate analysis at individual BBS routes. We estimated changes in similarity in species composition over time between 470,730 BBS route pairs. We also estimated the level of human activity at BBS routes using three spatial anthropogenic databases. Results BBS routes were located in non-urban areas in association with low nighttime light activity and moderately low human population densities. The analysis of diversity structure indicated the presence of two independent patterns: (1) a temporally consistent pattern defined by increasing species richness (12% increase from 1968 to 2003) associated with limited gains in taxonomic distinctness, and (2) an association between species abundance and evenness related to variability in abundance associated with the most abundant species. The similarity analysis indicated that BBS routes located closer to the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of the United States experienced the strongest patterns of homogenization of species composition. Main conclusions Our results suggest that avian diversity structure has changed at the local scale in non-urban areas in North America. However, there was no evidence for a consistent continent-wide pattern. Instead, the evidence pointed to the presence of regional factors influencing diversity patterns. This study provides a foundation for more detailed investigations of the spatiotemporal and taxonomic details of these general patterns.","New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",New Mexico State University,"New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, POB 30001 MSC 3AF, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",lasortef@missouri.edu,"La Sorte, Frank/A-2849-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,85,22,27,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,NA,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Location The contiguous United States and southern Canada. Methods We measured temporal turnover from 1968 to 2003 for 547 avian species at 1673 North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. We used the Euclidian distance between expected and observed presence/absence vectors and randomization tests to place species into two categories, common and not-common, and into three categories for common species: (1) always common, (2) common and colonizing, and (3) common and extirpated. We used these categories to identify species experiencing extreme colonization and extirpation events and to examine changes in species composition at BBS routes. We also determined how these patterns were associated with changes in species richness and changes in similarity in species composition. Results Nine of the 547 species represented outliers, where the number of BBS routes colonized greatly exceeded the number extirpated; no species showed extreme values for extirpation. The nine species colonized BBS routes primarily in the upper Midwest and north-eastern United States. Presence of the nine species at BBS routes was correlated with increasing net gain in common species (difference between common colonized and common extirpated), higher levels of species richness and increasing species richness over time, more similar species compositions and increasing similarity over time, and a greater prevalence of common species over not-common species. The literature indicates that all nine species experienced some form of geographical range expansion during the time of the survey involving four elements: (1) introduction and invasion; (2) the ability to use human-altered environments, including habitats associated with agricultural, suburban, or urban areas; (3) intensive management activities, including habitat improvements and reintroductions and (4) the ability to use habitats formed through forest regeneration. These factors in combination point to anthropogenic activities and related land use histories as the primary drivers of change. One of the nine species colonized regions well outside its historic geographical range and the remaining eight species were native within the regions they colonized. Main conclusions Our results suggest that a combination of anthropogenic activities promoted, within certain regions of North America, the geographical expansion of a limited number of common species that were native to those regions. These colonization events were correlated with changes in diversity structure, implying that large-scale diversity patterns were being influenced by anthropogenic activities. These changes can be characterized primarily by gains in species richness, an increased prevalence of common species, and more similar species compositions. Thus, using simple large-scale measures of diversity could be problematic if recent biogeographical patterns of species diversity are not considered. Specifically, using species richness or an indicator species to assess diversity could bias assessments towards common species whose populations have recently benefited through anthropogenic activities.","New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",New Mexico State University,"La Sorte, FA (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, POB 30001 MSC 3AF, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",flasorte@nmsu.edu,"La Sorte, Frank/A-2849-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46,38,50,1,35,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,NA,NA,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Because common and rare species are known to respond differently to anthropogenic activities at local scales these differential responses could, over time, be reflected in distributional patterns of species richness at larger spatial scales. This work tests the hypothesis that modern processes have played a role in shaping these patterns, by examining recent changes in the structure and composition of assemblages of breeding avifauna over a large geographical extent. Location The portion of North America containing the contiguous United States and southern Canada. Methods Changes in the geographical range structure of breeding avifauna in North America from 1968 to 2003 were analysed in regions containing historically moderate levels of anthropogenic activities. Two geographical measures, extent of occurrence and area of occupancy, were used to identify the level of rarity or commonality of individual species and to estimate, based on a vector analysis, patterns of change in geographical range structure for individual species and avian assemblages. Results More species experienced patterns of geographical range expansion (51%) than contraction (28%). The majority of avian assemblages (43%) displayed patterns of geographical range expansion: common species increased in number and proportion (6%) in association with reciprocal losses in rare and moderately rare species, resulting in a constant level of species richness. The minority of avian assemblages (21%) displayed patterns of geographical range contraction: gains occurred for common species as well as for rare and moderately rare species, resulting in substantial increases in species richness and a decline in the proportion of common species (4%). The remaining avian assemblages presented equivocal patterns characterized by gains in the number and proportion (2%) of common species and gains in species richness. Main conclusions Modern processes have played a role in shaping the distribution patterns of species richness at large spatial scales based on the composition of common and rare species. This suggests that anthropogenic activities cannot be ignored as a possible causal factor when considering ecological patterns at large spatial scales.","Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; New Mexico State University,"La Sorte, FA (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, 302 Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",lasortef@missouri.edu,"La Sorte, Frank/A-2849-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28,42,46,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,NA,J BIOGEOGR,J.

To determine how this influences our perception of biotic homogenization, we examined compositional patterns for avian assemblages over space and time along an occurrence-abundance continuum. Location The contiguous United States and southern Canada. Methods We examined avian assemblages at 951 Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes from 1970 to 2005 that contained a total of 443 species. We used five dissimilarity indices to estimate compositional patterns along an occurrence-abundance continuum of assemblage structure (from species occurrence to transformed abundance to raw abundance) for 396,925 unique combinations of BBS route pairs. We examined annual plots of dissimilarity by distance between BBS routes pairs to estimate spatial and temporal patterns for each index. Results Dissimilarity declined with increasing distance between route pairs for occurrence and transformed abundance, reaching an asymptote at approximately 2500 km. For raw abundance, dissimilarity peaked at intermediate distances (1000-2500 km) with no evidence of an asymptote. Avian assemblages became more similar over time at all points along the continuum. Occurrence and transformed abundance presented the weakest temporal trends, which were uniform or poorly delineated as a function of distance between routes. Raw abundance presented the strongest temporal trends, which declined in strength with increasing distance between routes. Main conclusions With the addition of abundance, there was a substantial and consistent pattern of degradation of beta-diversity for North American avifauna that differed considerably from that observed from occurrence data alone. The geographical expansion of a few species, which recently benefited from the direct and indirect consequences of anthropogenic activities, probably played a prominent role in these patterns. When broad-scale expansions in occupancy are evident, minor gains in similarity based on species occurrence can mask more substantial gains in similarity based on local abundance. When abundance information is unavailable, its role can be estimated by how occupancy has responded geographically to anthropogenic activities and the expectations of the abundance-occupancy relationship. Our findings support previous work indicating that widespread and locally abundant species will tend to benefit more from anthropogenic activities, creating a possible synergism that enhances biotic homogenization.","Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; Univ Tennessee, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"La Sorte, FA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Ecol Behav & Evolut Sect, 9500 Gilman Dr,MC 0116, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",flasorte@ucsd.edu,"La Sorte, Frank/A-2849-2009; mckinney, michael/AAK-6958-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,43,63,68,0,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,NA,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) are small songbirds that breed across North America. Data from Doppler weather radar and eBird indicate that Tree Swallow numbers increase throughout October and November in southeastern Louisiana, but then decrease during December. We thus hypothesized that southeastern Louisiana is a stopover area used by Tree Swallows during fall migration before they move to farther overwintering areas. We tested this hypothesis by attaching light-logging geolocators to Tree Swallows at five breeding sites spanning the species' breeding range from British Columbia to Nova Scotia, and then tracking their fall migration routes, stopover sites, and wintering locations. Of 38 individuals that returned in the following breeding season, 11 birds from three breeding sites (Saskatchewan, Wisconsin, and Ontario) used southeastern Louisiana as a stopover site. Arrival date and duration of stay closely matched observations from both eBird and radar data. From Louisiana, most Tree Swallows continued their migration to one of three wintering sites: peninsular Florida, the Bahamas, or the Yucatan Peninsula, whereas two birds remained until spring within 200 km of the stopover area. Our results (1) suggest that southeastern Louisiana is an extended stopover site for Tree Swallows that originate from a wide geographic range on the breeding grounds; and (2) demonstrate how geolocators, combined with other sources of movement information, reveal habitat use throughout the annual cycle.","[Laughlin, Andrew J.; Taylor, Caz M.] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Bradley, David W.; LeClair, Dayna; Norris, D.

However, the potential synergies between them are currently poorly understood. Identifying the spatial patterns and factors driving their co-occurrence across different climatic zones is critical to more effectively conserve forest ecosystems at the regional level. Here, we integrated information of National Forest Inventories and Breeding Bird Atlases across Europe and North America (Spain and Quebec, respectively), covering five subclimates (steppe, dry Mediterranean, humid Mediterranean, boreal, and temperate). In particular, this study aimed to (1) determine the spatial patterns of both forest carbon stocks and biodiversity (bird richness, tree richness, and overall biodiversity) and the factors that influence them; (2) establish the relationships between forest carbon stocks and biodiversity; and (3) define and characterize the areas of high (hotspots) and low (coldspots) values of carbon and biodiversity, and ultimately quantify their spatial overlap. Our results show that the factors affecting carbon and biodiversity vary between regions and subclimates. The highest values of carbon and biodiversity were found in northern Spain (humid Mediterranean subclimate) and southern Quebec (temperate subclimate) where there was more carbon as climate conditions were less limiting. High density and structural diversity simultaneously favored carbon stocks, tree, and overall biodiversity, especially in isolated and mountainous areas, often associated with steeper slopes and low accessibility. In addition, the relationship between carbon stocks and biodiversity was positive in both regions and all subclimates, being stronger where climate is a limiting factor for forest growth. The spatial overlap between hotspots of carbon and biodiversity provides an excellent opportunity for landscape planning to maintain carbon stocks and conserve biodiversity. The variables positively affecting carbon and biodiversity were also driving the hotspots of both carbon and biodiversity, emphasizing the viability of win-win solutions. Our results highlight the need to jointly determine the spatial patterns of ecosystem services and biodiversity for an effective and sustainable planning of forest landscapes that simultaneously support conservation and mitigate climate change.","[Lecina-Diaz, Judit; Alvarez, Albert; Retana, Javier] CREAF, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain; [Regos, Adrian] CIBIO InBIO, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, ECOCHANGE Grp, Vairao, Portugal; [Regos, Adrian] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Zooloxia Xenet & Antropoloxia Fis, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Regos, Adrian] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CEMFOR CTFC, St Llorenc de Morunys Km 2, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Drapeau, Pierre; Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Drapeau, Pierre; Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ H2X 3Y7, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain",Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Lecina-Diaz, J (corresponding author), CREAF, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.",j.lecina@creaf.uab.cat,"Lecina, Judit/JOZ-9383-2023; Regos, Adrian/M-5207-2014","Drapeau, Pierre/0000-0002-1115-2531; Regos, Adrian/0000-0003-1983-936X; Paquette, Alain/0000-0003-1048-9674; Alvarez Nebot, Albert/0000-0002-7592-9944; Lecina-Diaz, Judit/0000-0002-6867-5886",Marie Curie IRSES project NEWFORESTS [PIRSES-GA-2013-612645]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness project FORESTCAST [CGL2014-59742-C2-1-R]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2015-073854]; Xunta de Galicia [ED481B2016/084-0],Marie Curie IRSES project NEWFORESTS(Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness project FORESTCAST; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),"Many thanks to A.

Although it has been predicted that avian distributions are more likely to covary with physiognomy than with floristics at coarse scales, we sought to determine, more specifically, whether there remained a significant association between gradients in assemblages of bird species and dominant plant species within a general biome type, after statistically controlling for structural variation and geographical location of sampling sites. Location Our sample consisted of a subset of North American Breeding Bird Census survey sites that covered most of the range of eastern forests, from Florida to Nova Scotia, and west to Minnesota and North Dakota (up to c. 2500 km between sites). Methods We restricted our analyses to the single year (1981) that provided the largest sample of sites (47) for which vegetation data were available within +/- 2 years of the avian surveys. We examined the relationship between avian community composition and tree species composition over this series of forested plots. Data were divided into four sets: (1) bird species abundances, (2) tree species abundances, (3) physiognomic or structural variables and (4) geographical location (latitude and longitude). We performed separate detrended correspondence analysis ordinations of birds and trees, before and after statistically partialling out covariation associated with structural variables and geographical location. To gauge the relationship between the two sets of species we correlated site scores resulting from separate ordinations. We also compared continental-scale patterns of variation in bird and tree assemblages to understand possible mechanisms controlling species distribution at that scale. Results Both bird and tree communities yielded strong gradients, with first-axis eigenvalues from 0.75 to 0.97. All gradients were relatively long (> 4.0), implying complete turnover in species composition. However, geographical location accounted for < 10% of the total variation associated with any ordination. Prior to partialling out covariation resulting from location and physiognomy, bird species ordinations were strongly correlated with tree species ordinations. The strength of association was reduced after partialling, but one bird and one tree axis remained significantly correlated. There was a significant species-area effect for birds, but not for trees. Main conclusions There was a significant relationship between bird species assemblages and tree species assemblages in the eastern forests of North America. Even after partialling out covariation associated with spatial location and forest physiognomy, there remained a significant correlation between major axes from bird and tree ordinations, consistent with the hypothesis that floristic variation is likely to be important in organizing assemblages of birds within a general biome type, albeit over a much larger spatial extent than originally predicted. Forest tree species ordinations differed from bird species ordinations in several ways: trees had a higher rate of turnover along underlying environmental gradients; trees appeared more patchily distributed than birds at this scale; and tree species were more spaced out along the underlying ecological gradients, with less overlap. By understanding the relationship between bird assemblages and forest floristics, we might better understand how avian communities are likely to change if tree species distributions are altered as a result of climatic changes.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",john.rotenberry@ucr.edu,"Lee, Pey-Yi/H-4360-2011","Lee, Pey-Yi/0000-0002-5201-9892",NA,NA,NA,NA,69,92,119,2,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,NA,J BIOGEOGR,J.

The contamination of these birds may pose a greater risk to those who regularly hunt and consumed infected species. Due to resident concerns communicated by local Band Council, hunter-harvested birds from a remote First Nation community in subArctic Ontario, Canada were assessed for AIV. Hunters, and especially those who live a subsistence lifestyle, are at higher risk of AIV exposure due to their increased contact with wild birds, which represent an important part of their diet. Methods: Cloacal swabs from 304 harvested game birds representing several species of wild birds commonly hunted and consumed in this First Nation community were analyzed for AIV using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Subtyping was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sequences were assembled using Lasergene, and the sequences were compared to Genbank. Results: In total, 16 of the 304 cloacal swab samples were positive for AIV. Of the 16 positive samples, 12 were found in mallard ducks, 3 were found in snow geese (wavies), and 1 positive sample was found in partridge. The AIV samples were subtyped, when possible, and found to be positive for the low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtypes H3 and H4. No samples were positive for subtypes of human concern, namely H5 and H7. Conclusions: This work represents the first AIV monitoring program results of hunter-harvested birds in a remote subsistence First Nation community. Community-level surveillance of AIV in remote subsistence hunting communities may help to identify future risks, while educating those who may have the highest exposure about proper handling of hunted birds. Ultimately, only low pathogenic strains of AIV were found, but monitoring should be continued and expanded to safeguard those with the highest exposure risk to AIV.","[Liberda, E.

Analysis of CBC data is complicated by substantial variation among sites and years in effort expended in counting; this feature of the CBC is common to many other wildlife surveys. Specification of a method for adjusting counts for effort is a matter of some controversy. Here, we present models for longitudinal count surveys with varying effort; these describe the effect of effort as proportional to exp(B effort(P)), where B and p are parameters. For any fixed p, our models are loglinear in the transformed explanatory variable (effort)(P) and other covariables. Hence, we fit a collection of loglinear models corresponding to a range of values of p and select the best effort adjustment from among these on the basis of fit statistics.

Large-scale biodiversity information resources now available offer opportunities to fill this gap for many parts of the world via detailed, quantitative comparisons of assemblage composition, particularly for regions without rich time series datasets. We explore the possibility that such changes in avifaunas across the United States and Canada before and after the first three decades of marked global change (i.e., prior to 1980 versus after 2010) can be reconstructed and characterized from existing primary biodiversity data. As an illustration of the potential of this methodology for sites even in regions not as well sampled as the United States and Canada, we also explored changes at a single site in Mexico (Chichen-Itza.). We analyzed two large-scale datasets: one summarizing bird records in the United States and Canada before 1980, and one for the same region after 2010. We used probabilistic inventory completeness analyses to identify sites that have avifaunas that have likely been inventoried more or less completely. We prepared detailed comparisons between the two time periods to analyze species showing distributional changes over the time period analyzed. We identified 139 sites on a 0.05 degrees grid that were demonstrably well-inventoried before 1980 in the United States and Canada, of which 108 were also well-inventoried after 2010. Comparing presence/absence patterns between the two time periods for 601 bird species, we found significant spatial autocorrelation in overall avifaunal turnover (species gained and lost), but not in numbers of species lost. We noted potential northward retractions of ranges of several species with high-latitude (boreal) distributions, while other species showed dominant patterns of population loss, either rangewide (e.g., Tympanuchus cupido) or regionally (e.g., Thryomanes bewickii). We developed linear models to explore a suite of potential drivers of species loss at relatively fine-grained resolutions (<6 km), finding significant effects of precipitation increase, particularly on the eastern border of the United States and Canada. Our exploration of biotic change in Chichen-Itza included 265 species and showed intriguing losses from the local avifauna (e.g., Patagioenas speciosa), as well as vagrant and recent invasive species in the Yucatan Peninsula. The present work documents both the potential for and the problems involved in an approach integrating primary biodiversity data across time periods. This method potentially allows researchers to assess intermediate-time-scale biodiversity dynamics that can reveal patterns of change in biodiversity-rich regions that lack extensive time-series information.","[Machado-Stredel, Fernando; Freeman, Benedictus; Cobos, Marlon E.; Nunez-Penichet, Claudia; Jimenez, Laura; Perktas, Utku; Khalighifar, Ali; Ingenloff, Kate; Tapondjou, Walter; de Silva, Thilina; Fernando, Sumudu; Peterson, A.

Eight years of point count data were collected over the 14 years of the study, 1998-2011. Trends were estimated for 50 bird species using generalized linear mixed-effects models, with random effects to account for temporal (repeat sampling within years) and spatial (stations within stands) autocorrelation and variability associated with multiple observers. We tested whether regional and national Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) trends could, on average, predict trends in our study area. Significant increases in our study area outnumbered decreases by 12 species to 6, an opposite pattern compared to Alberta (6 versus 15, respectively) and Canada (9 versus 20). Twenty-two species with relatively precise trend estimates (precision to detect > 30% decline in 10 years; observed SE <= 3.7%/year) showed nonsignificant trends, similar to Alberta (24) and Canada (20). Precision-weighted trends for a sample of 19 species with both reliable trends at our site and small portions of their range covered by BBS in Canada were, on average, more negative for Alberta (1.34% per year lower) and for Canada (1.15% per year lower) relative to Fort Liard, though 95% credible intervals still contained zero. We suggest that part of the differences could be attributable to local resource pulses (insect outbreak). However, we also suggest that the tendency for BBS route coverage to disproportionately sample more southerly, developed areas in the boreal forest could result in BBS trends that are not representative of range-wide trends for species whose range is centred farther north.","[Machtans, Craig S.; Kardynal, Kevin J.] Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Gatineau, PQ, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Machtans, CS (corresponding author), 91780 Alaska Highway, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 5X7, Canada.",craig.machtans@ec.gc.ca,NA,"Smith, Paul/0000-0001-9573-5218",Environment Canada; Aboriginal Affairs; Northern Development Canada; Government of the Northwest Territories,Environment Canada(CGIAR); Aboriginal Affairs; Northern Development Canada; Government of the Northwest Territories,"We are very grateful to the 24 field assistants who worked hard to collect all this data, especially to Lindsay Armer.

Despite decades of conservation concern, steep declines of grassland birds continue. Key to optimizing conservation effort is understanding how land-use practices, such as agriculture, across the annual cycle affect population status. Determining the relative influence of impacts on grassland bird declines is difficult given that the most robust estimate of trends, the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), is conducted throughout agriculturally dominated regions. Our goal was to explore whether agriculture during the breeding season is a major driver of grassland bird declines, by evaluating population trends in regions with different amounts of agricultural development. We derived trends for 16 bird species spanning 23 years (1994-2016) at a large (459 km(2)), native prairie site, Suffield National Wildlife Area (SNWA) in Alberta, Canada. We compared those trends with the BBS across three spatial scales, a regional monitoring scheme with higher than average native grass cover (Grassland Bird Monitoring [GBM]), Bird Conservation Region 11 Canada (Canada), and all of Bird Conservation Region 11 (BCR 11). Trends measured as annual percent change and credible interval varied greatly among species and survey strata. Across all species, declines were greatest for Canada (-1.3%, CI: -2.8, 0.0) and BCR 11 (-1.9%, CI: -3.2, -0.6). This contrasts with positive trends for GBM routes (1.0%, CI: -0.4, 2.3) and the SNWA data (1.7%, CI: 0.3, 3.3). Six of 16 species at SNWA were increasing with one decreasing. Five species increased at GBM and four declined. Canada had 10 species declines and 3 increases and BCR 11 had 10 declines and no increases. None of the six grassland obligate species declined at SNWA, two declined at GBM, and all six declined over the two larger BBS strata. Our results showing fewer negative population trends at a large native grassland site compared with BBS at three spatial scales across the North American prairies support the prediction that agricultural intensification on breeding grounds may be driving population declines and protection of native grasslands is a key component of grassland bird conservation efforts.","[Mahony, Nancy A.] Wildlife Res Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Dale, Brenda C.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Miller, David A.

The majority of new data on this duck come from the Kimmirut area of southeastern Baffin Island, where surveys in the 1930s also found the species. However, it occurs as far west as Cape Dorset, and as far north as Clyde River.

Current limited knowledge of REE distribution in undisturbed subarctic environments and their bioaccumulation within northern species is addressed through a collaborative community-based environmental monitoring program in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada). This study provides background REE values (lanthanides + yttrium) and investigates REE anomalies (i.e., deviations from standard pattern) across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems in an area where a REE mining project is in development. Results are characteristic of a biodilution of REE, with the highest mean total REE concentrations (sigma REE) reported in sediments (102 nmol/g) and low trophic level organisms (i.e., biofilm, macroalgae, macroinvertebrates, common mussels, and reindeer lichens; 101-102 nmol/g), and the lowest mean concentrations in higher-level consumers (i.e., goose, ptarmigan, char, whitefish, cod, sculpin and seal; 10-2 - 101 nmol/g). The animal tissues are of importance to northern villages and analyses demonstrate a species-specific bioaccumulation of REE, with mean concentrations up to 40 times greater in liver compared to muscle, with bones and kidneys presenting intermediate concentrations and the lowest in blubber. Further, a tissue-specific fractionation was presented, with significant light REE (LREE) enrichment compared to heavy REE (HREE) in consumer livers (LREE/HREE approximately equal to 101) and the most pronounced negative cerium (Ce) anomalies (<0. 80) in liver and bones of fish species. These fractionation patterns, along with novel negative relationships presented between fish size (length, mass) and Ce anomalies suggest metabolic, ecological, and/or environmental influences on REE bioaccumulation and distribution within biota. Background concentration data will be useful in the establishment of REE guidelines; and the trends discussed support the use of Ce anomalies as bio-markers for REE processing in animal species, which requires further investigation to better understand their controlling factors.","[Marginson, Holly; MacMillan, Gwyneth A.; Amyot, Marc] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, GRIL, Complexe Sci, 1375 Ave Therese Lavoie Roux, Montreal, PQ H2V 0B3, Canada; [Grant, Eliane] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Gerin-Lajoie, Jose] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Gerin-Lajoie, Jose; Amyot, Marc] Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; University of Quebec; University Quebec Abitibi-Temiscamingue; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres,"Amyot, M (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, GRIL, Complexe Sci, 1375 Ave Therese Lavoie Roux, Montreal, PQ H2V 0B3, Canada.",m.amyot@umontreal.ca,"Amyot, Marc/A-7182-2008",NA,"ArcticNet Grant [21 (2019-2023)]; Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) [1920-HQ-000150]; Canada Research Chairs Program; Anguvigaq, the Nunavik Hunting, Fishing and Trapping Organization (HFTA); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); Northern Scientific Training Program; Alexander Graham Bell Canada Scholarship (NSERC); W.

Such monitoring will be important for tracking long-term population trends of songbirds, especially for species breeding in remote areas such as the North American boreal forest. The geographical catchment sampled by individual MMS, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we used hydrogen isotope measurements (delta D) of feathers of white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) moving through Delta Marsh MMS in Manitoba, Canada, to determine both wintering and breeding ground catchment areas monitored by this station. The delta D of tall feathers, collected from spring and fall migrants delineated previous breeding or natal latitudes, ranging from the northern to the southern extremes of the western boreal forest. The delta D values of head feathers grown on the wintering grounds and collected during spring migration revealed that individuals wintered in a broad region of the southeastern United States. The isotope data showed no relationship between estimated breeding/natal and wintering latitudes of white-throated sparrow populations. Stable isotope data provided little information on longitude. Band-encounter analyses, however, indicated a clear east-west segregation of these sparrows across Canada, supporting connectivity among breeding/natal and wintering longitudes over the entire scale of this species' range. Isotope analyses of multiple feather types representing different periods and geographic regions of the annual cycle can provide key information on migratory connectivity for species moving through dedicated MMS.","Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X4, Canada; Environm Canada, Natl Water Res Inst, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; National Water Research Institute,"Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada.",dan.mazerolle@ec.gc.ca,"Wassenaar, Leonard/B-5996-2013; Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019","Wassenaar, Leonard/0000-0001-5532-0771",NA,NA,NA,NA,53,41,54,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,NA,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,144,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,541,549,NA,10.1007/s00442-005-0031-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-005-0031-6,NA,NA,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,959SG,15800746,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000231539000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We review studies and conservation databases to determine priorities for raptor conservation within the USA and Canada. We specifically examine databases compiled by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), BirdLife International, Partners in Flight, the Raptor Population Index, state wildlife agencies, and NatureServe. Of the 56 breeding raptor species that IUCN considers to occur within the two countries, the most pressing conservation challenge is the California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus). This species is the only North American raptor that is Critically Endangered according to the IUCN, and the only one ranked as Critically Imperiled by NatureServe. Other priority species according to IUCN are the 'Io (Buteo solitarius; Near Threatened), the Spotted Owl (Stria occidentalis; Near Threatened), and the Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus; Vulnerable). Fifteen subspecies are listed as Imperiled or Vulnerable by NatureServe, and six of these are listed as either birds of conservation concern or are listed by the USA Endangered Species Act. Priority subspecies include residents of Haida Gwaii (formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands) and Puerto Rico, as well as the Northern Spotted Owl (S. o. caurina). Some abundant and widespread species are of conservation concern because of ongoing, continent-wide population declines. Vultures are the most abundant raptors in the USA and Canada and are increasing in number. The current status of raptors across the USA and Canada is generally secure, but there are some important conservation priorities.","[McClure, Christopher J.

North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were introduced to Newfoundland, Canada, during the 1960s and have been hypothesized as a cause of the precipitous decline of the Newfoundland Gray-cheeked Thrush (Catharus minimus minimus). To test the prediction that the impacts of squirrels led to range contraction by thrushes, we completed 1960 point count surveys for squirrel and thrush over two years (2016 and 2017) in western Newfoundland. Thrushes and squirrels were strongly segregated by elevation, with thrushes now being commonly detected at only high elevation, squirrels being detected most frequently at low elevation, and both species being rare and inversely likely to be present at intermediate elevations. We evaluated local (5.5 ha) and landscape (490.8 ha) scale habitat affiliations of thrushes using landcover data from a provincial forest resource inventory to assess the potential for synergistic impacts on thrush of squirrel invasion and forest management. Gray-cheeked Thrushes were associated with regenerating (10-30 years post-harvest) clear-cuts, conifer forest, and tall scrub at the local scale, but avoided tall scrub, regenerating stands, and second growth forest at the landscape scale. Regenerating clear-cuts and modified strip cuts were selected by thrushes at a local scale. Breeding Bird Survey data show that Gray-cheeked Thrushes were abundant at lower elevations prior to the expansion of squirrels across Newfoundland, so our finding of strong elevational segregation adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that the introduction of squirrels played an important role in the sudden decline and range contraction of this insular songbird subspecies. Management for squirrels should include efforts to prevent spread upslope and to nearshore islands while more study is done on this and other hypotheses regarding the cause of Gray-cheeked Thrush decline, as well as on relevant aspects of the ecology of this little-studied thrush.","[McDermott, Jenna P.

Five species of marsh-nesting colonial waterbirds are poorly monitored in Canada, and especially so in the core of their range in the Canadian Prairie Provinces (Alberta. Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). We summarized published and unpublished data on abundance and distribution of breeding colonies of Western Grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis), Franklin's Gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan), Black Tern (Chlidonias niger), Forster's Tern (Sterna forsteri), and Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. We also examined the degree of overlap in nesting phenology (egg dates) and summarized survey methods that have been used to monitor the species during the breeding season-information that may be useful for the development of a multispecies monitoring program. For all species. the largest number of records of breeding colonies occurred in Alberta, with records declining eastward through Saskatchewan and Manitoba. We identified a number of breeding colonies occurring outside of currently defined species ranges, especially for the poorly studied Forster's Tern. Of 137 waterbodies hosting a colony of at least one species over the past 10 yr, 57 (41.6%) hosted colonies of at least 2 species, and 3 (2.2%) hosted colonies of all 5 species. Species tended to be reasonably synchronous in their breeding phenology, but Franklin's Gulls and Black-crowned Night-Ilerons tended to initiate nesting slightly earlier than the other species. We conclude that a multispecies survey timed in late May or early June to count nests and/or incubating adults, using either ground-based or aerial surveys, would likely be the most appropriate for monitoring all species jointly in the Prairie Provinces.

The Canadian Lakes Loon Survey (CLLS), a monitoring program involving volunteers, was initiated in 1981 to collect information on loon reproductive success, such as the number of loons nesting and the number of young they produce which survive to fledging, to help researchers determine whether loons were adversely affected by acid rain or human disturbance. Between 1987 and 1993, 4236 records for loons nesting on 1529 lakes in Ontario (historically the principal region of study) were received from volunteers. We used logistic regression to examine relationships between loon productivity (number of large young produced per pair for 721 lakes), lake area, and pH (from provincial and federal databases). After controlling for lake size, we determined that loons were less likely to nest on acid lakes (pH<5.5), and when they did attempt to breed, their reproductive success was lower, in part doe to the reduced survival of two-chick broods, presumably linked to reduced fish biomass. However, we found no conclusive evidence that breeding success exhibited any temporal trends in relation to pH over this time period. Continued monitoring by volunteers of loon reproduction on CLLS lakes will provide a reliable, cost-effective method of assessing the long-term health of large, acid-sensitive lakes across Canada.","CANADIAN CTR STUDY & PRESERVAT BIRDS,PORT ROWAN,ON N0E 1M0,CANADA",NA,"Mcnicol, DK (corresponding author), ENVIRONM CANADA,CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV,NEPEAN,ON K1A 0H3,CANADA.",NA,"Mallory, Mark/A-1952-2017","Mallory, Mark/0000-0003-2744-3437",NA,NA,NA,NA,8,21,22,0,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0049-6979,NA,NA,WATER AIR SOIL POLL,Water Air Soil Pollut.,DEC,85,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,463,468,NA,10.1007/BF00476872,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476872,NA,NA,6,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,UB053,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:A1995UB05300030,View Full Record in Web of Science

Researchers suggest these decreased abundances of ducks may be related to winter warming and related climatic phenomena. Accordingly, we tested predictions that duck abundance was increasing more at northern than southern latitudes, and that trends were related to average winter temperatures (Dec-Jan). We tested predictions using National Audubon Society Christmas Bird Count (CBC) data collected during December 1969 through January 2019 from 31 states in the United States and 6 Canadian provinces that comprise the Atlantic and Mississippi flyways for 16 species of dabbling and diving ducks (Anatinae). We found support for the prediction that CBC trends in duck abundance vary with latitude, and mean winter temperature explained nearly half the variation in CBC trends for 12 of 16 species. For some species, trends were negative in warmer regions and positive in colder regions. For others, trends were stable or slightly positive in warmer regions but more positive in colder regions. These results provide empirical evidence supporting climate-influenced winter range changes by important game duck species and suggest challenges and opportunities for waterfowl population, habitat, and hunting management in North America and the northern hemisphere.

Climate change is thought to be one of the most influential drivers of range shifts, but the effects of other confounded ecological processes are often ignored even though these processes may modify expected range responses to climate change. To determine the relative effects of climate, forest availability, connectivity, and biotic processes such as immigration and establishment, we examine range changes occurring in a species of bird, the Hooded Warbler (Wilsonia citrina). We focus predominantly on the periphery of the species' northern range in Canada but we also examine data from the entire species' range. Nesting records in southern Ontario were obtained from two breeding bird Atlases of Ontario separated by a period of 20 years (1981-1985 and 2001-2005), and the rate of range expansion was estimated by comparing the number of occupied areas in each Atlas. Twelve hypotheses of the relationship between the rate of range expansion and factors known to influence range change were examined using model-selection techniques and a mixed modeling approach (zero-inflated Poisson's regression). Cooler temperatures were positively related to a lack of range expansion indicating that climate constrained the species' distribution. Establishment probability (based on the number of occupied, neighboring Atlas squares) and immigration from populations to the south (estimated using independent data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey) were also important predictors of range expansion. These biotic process variables can mask the effects of forest availability and connectivity on range expansion. Expansion due to climate change may be slower in fragmented systems, but the rate of expansion will be influenced largely by biotic processes such as proximity to neighboring populations.","[Melles, S.

A retrospective analysis (1971-96) was done to investigate relationships between counts of 29 bird species made on Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes with a spatially explicit granular use index (derived from surveys made in 1980-85) and an index of land use change (derived from Principal Components Analysis of agricultural statistics) for 30 Census Agricultural Regions (CARS). Controlling for spatial location and the land use change index, abundance of American robin (Turdus migratorius), horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), and western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) was negatively correlated with insecticide use; only two species showed evidence of a positive correlation. At a shorter time scale, for which we had direct estimates of pesticide use (1980-85), we also found evidence that the black-billed magpie (Pica pica), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) were less abundant in areas where granular insecticide use was high. Population trends (% annual change between 1971-96) were negatively correlated with the granular index for horned lark, house sparrow, and western meadowlark. Although correlational only, our results suggest that granular insecticides may be an important factor influencing population changes in some bird species in prairie farmland.","Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; Aquila Appl Ecologists, Carlsbad Springs, ON K0A 1K0, Canada; Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; University of Alberta,"Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Carleton Univ Campus,1125 Colonel By Dr,Raven Rd, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada.",Pierre.Mineau@ec.gc.ca,"Downes, Meghan/LBH-6268-2024; Kirk, David/AAA-7465-2021; Bayne, Erin/IUP-1777-2023","Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521",NA,NA,NA,NA,62,32,39,1,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,NA,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,NA,12,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,267,278,NA,10.2980/i1195-6860-12-2-267.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.2980/i1195-6860-12-2-267.1,NA,NA,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,941UK,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000230239500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Significant declines were recorded most consistently for Least Sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), Semipalmated Sandpiper (C. pusilla), and Short-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), and decreases for Red Knot (C. canutus) and Black-bellied Plover (Pluvialis squatarola) approached statistical significance in some analyses. Population trends were not constant but varied consistently across species during different phases of the study period. Declines occurred ih most of the 13 species analyzed during the latter part of the 1970s, followed by increases during the first half of the 1980s, with a less marked tendency towards declines in recent years. A series of cold summers on the breeding grounds during the 1970s may have led to the observed population declines at that time. Statistical power analysis indicated that population changes of 2-5% should be detected at 80% power for the number of sites and years of coverage for which data were available.","CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV,NATL WILDLIFE RES CTR,HULL K1A 0H3,PQ,CANADA",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29,55,63,0,19,WILSON ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,ANN ARBOR,"MUSEUM OF ZOOLOGY UNIV MICHIGAN, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109",0043-5643,NA,NA,WILSON BULL,Wilson Bull.,SEP,106,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,431,447,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,PK023,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:A1994PK02300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Studies at different scales have shown mixed consequences of urban areas for ecological communities and biodiversity. Here, we use geographic data on urban extent and survey data from the Christmas Bird Count to investigate the influence of urbanization on winter bird diversity over a continental scale. We compared the alpha (local richness) and beta diversity (turnover with distance) of 42 urban bird communities to nearby non-urban communities. We investigated the processes underlying beta diversity between non-urban and urban sites by comparing the frequency of occurrence in species and variability in relative abundances across sites. Alpha diversity was statistically indistinguishable between urban and non-urban sites when controlling for latitude. Community similarity decreased less rapidly over distance in urban compared to non-urban sites, indicating that spatial homogenization from urbanization results in lower beta diversity. Eighteen species of non-native or native generalists occurred across all urban sites, whereas no species occurred in all non-urban sites. Mean-variance scaling of relative abundance shows that species in urban sites maintained similar levels of community dominance across space compared to non-urban sites. The widespread presence of urban species is likely due to similarity in habitats among cities compared to nearby non-urban sites. The decreased variability in relative abundance of urban species is possibly due to urban resource subsidies (e.g., bird feeders, garbage, and irrigation) and shelter (e.g., landscaping, buildings, and microclimates). The increased occurrence of widespread species in cities and less variation in relative abundances across urban sites contribute to the homogenizing effect of cities on avian communities.","[Murthy, Adeline C.; Fristoe, Trevor S.; Burger, Joseph R.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Fristoe, Trevor S.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Burger, Joseph R.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of New Mexico; Washington University (WUSTL); University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Murthy, AC (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",adelinemurthy@gmail.com,NA,"Fristoe, Trevor/0000-0002-3894-8126; Burger, Joseph/0000-0002-7361-3858",National Science Foundation Grant [NSF-DEB 0731350]; Program in Interdisciplinary Biological and Biomedical Sciences (PIBBS) at the University of New Mexico (National Institute of Health Grant) [T32EB009414],National Science Foundation Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Program in Interdisciplinary Biological and Biomedical Sciences (PIBBS) at the University of New Mexico (National Institute of Health Grant),"We thank James H.

Sanderlings that migrate north to the Arctic from Chile and Peru travel principally through the central corridor (Texas and northward) of the United States and Canada; smaller numbers follow the Pacific coast. A few migrate north from the Pacific coast of South America along the Atlantic coast of the United States. Southbound from the Arctic to coastal Chile and Peru, many individuals switch eastward to stopovers on the Atlantic coast, including birds that migrated north along the U.S. Pacific coast. Sanderlings banded in Brazil during the nonbreeding period appear only on the U.s. Atlantic coast in migration. Our results emphasize the individual nature of migration. We found considerable heterogeneity in migratory behavior among individuals that spend the nonbreeding season together on the same beaches. Individuals from widely separated nonbreeding sites often shared similar pathways.

This paper explores local tacit knowledge application to identify wildlife locations, movement patterns and heightened opportunities and barriers for connectivity conservation planning in a critical linkage area known as the Chignecto Isthmus in the eastern Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Thirty-four local hunters, loggers, farmers and others with strong tacit knowledge of wildlife and the land participated in individual interviews and group workshops, both of which engaged participatory mapping. Individuals' data were digitised, analysed and compiled into thematic series of maps, which were refined through participatory, consensus-based workshops. Locations of key populations and movement patterns for several species were delineated, predominantly for terrestrial mammals and migratory birds. When comparing local tacit-knowledge-based maps with those derived from formal-natural-science models, key differences and strong overlap were apparent. Local participants provided rich explanatory and complementary data. Their engagement in the process fostered knowledge transfer within the group and increased confidence in their experiential knowledge and its value for decision making. Benefits derived from our study for conservation planning in the region include enhanced spatial data on key locations of wildlife populations and movement pathways and local insights into wildlife changes over time. Identified contributing factors primarily relate to habitat degradation and fragmentation from human activities (i.e., land use and cover changes caused by roads and forestry practices), thereby supporting the need for conservation measures. The generated knowledge is important for consideration in local planning initiatives; it addresses gaps in existing formal-science data and validates or ground truths the outputs of existing computer-based models of wildlife habitat and movement pathways within the context of the complex social-ecological systems of the place and local people. Critically, awareness of the need for conservation and the value of the participants' shared knowledge has been enhanced, with potential influence in fostering local engagement in wildlife conservation and other planning initiatives. Consistent with other studies, engagement of local people and their tacit knowledge was found to (i) provide important insights, knowledge translation, and dissemination to complement formal, natural science, (ii) help build a more inclusive knowledge system grounded in the people and place, and (iii) lend support to conservation action for connectivity planning and human-wildlife co-existence. More broadly, our methods demonstrate an effective approach for representing differences and consensus among participants' spatial indications of wildlife and habitat as a means of co-producing knowledge in participatory mapping for conservation planning.","[Needham, Jessica L.; Beazley, Karen F.; Papuga, Victoria P.] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Needham, JL (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",jessica.needham@dal.ca; karen.beazley@dal.ca; v.papuga@dal.ca,"; Beazley, Karen/A-5760-2019","Papuga, Victoria/0000-0002-6380-7165; Beazley, Karen/0000-0002-2997-6221","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2018-00792]; Faculty of Graduate Studies, Dalhousie University","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Faculty of Graduate Studies, Dalhousie University","This research was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Insight Development Grant #430-2018-00792) to K.

For the overwhelming majority of species, we lack long-term information on the dynamics of populations. As a consequence, we face considerable uncertainty about how to discriminate among competing hypotheses of population decline and design conservation plans. 2. The marbled murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus is a small seabird that nests in coastal old-growth forest but feeds year-round in near-shore waters of the north-eastern Pacific. Although a decline in nesting habitat is the primary reason why marbled murrelets are listed as threatened in Canada, nest predation and food availability may also influence population abundance. To examine the hypothesis that murrelet populations are influenced by variation in diet quality, we analysed stable-carbon and -nitrogen isotopes in feathers of museum specimens collected in the Georgia Basin, British Columbia. 3. Between 1889 and 1996, we found a decline in stable isotopic signatures that was approximately equal to a 62% drop in trophic feeding level. We also found that the estimated proportion of fish in murrelet diet was related closely to murrelet abundance over the past 40 years, as estimated from volunteer surveys. Using these isotopic data, we modelled population size as a function of variation in reproductive rate due to changes in diet quality and found that our model matched closely the 40-year field estimates. We then applied our 107-year isotopic record to the model to back-cast estimates of population growth rate to 1889. 4. Our results suggest that, up to the 1950s, murrelet populations in the Georgia Basin were capable of growing and were probably limited by factors other than diet quality. After this period, however, our results imply that murrelets were often, but not solely, limited by diet quality. 5. Synthesis and applications. Protecting nesting habitat may not be sufficient to rebuild populations of this highly secretive and threatened seabird and recovery might also require the restoration of marine habitat quality, as well as a better understanding of how ocean climate affects prey abundance and reproductive rate. Combined with contemporary demographic data, stable isotope analysis of historic samples provides a unique opportunity to reconstruct population histories for species where we lack long-term information.","Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Aquat Res Lab, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Fisheries & Oceans Canada Inst Ocean Sci, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada; Queens Univ, Dept Geol Sci & Geol Engn, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Guelph; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Queens University - Canada,"Norris, DR (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",rnorris@uoguelph.ca,"Norris, Ryan/F-4720-2011","Kyser, Kurt/0000-0001-9667-4103",NA,NA,NA,NA,59,66,81,1,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,NA,J APPL ECOL,J.

Long-term trends at the continental and regional level showed widespread declines in the number of kestrels counted during both fall migration and winter. The lone exception was in western North America where declining migration counts were evident, but could at least partly be explained by increasing winter counts. These results suggest that western kestrels are shifting migratory tendencies, migrating shorter distances (short-stopping), or are not migrating at all. This contrasts with patterns in central and eastern North America where kestrel counts declined in both fall and winter over the last 20- and 30-yr periods. Recent trends (2009-2019) showed less widespread declines in both fall and winter across North America and for most regions, suggesting kestrel declines might have moderated in the past decade.

Long-term trends at the continental and regional level showed widespread declines in the number of kestrels counted during both fall migration and winter. The lone exception was in western North America where declining migration counts were evident, but could at least partly be explained by increasing winter counts. These results suggest that western kestrels are shifting migratory tendencies, migrating shorter distances (short-stopping), or are not migrating at all. This contrasts with patterns in central and eastern North America where kestrel counts declined in both fall and winter over the last 20- and 30-yr periods. Recent trends (2009-2019) showed less widespread declines in both fall and winter across North America and for most regions, suggesting kestrel declines might have moderated in the past decade.

Although this important survey provides trend estimates for more than 400 species, it has limited coverage in the boreal forest and biases in representation and detectability that complicate inference. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the potential of new technologies and analytical approaches to increase coverage and improve monitoring efficiency. We documented variation in counts between BBS surveys (hereafter human BBS) and different on-road and forest-edge surveys using autonomous recording units (ARUs) from 3 routes in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Specifically, we quantified percent differences (i.e., bias in counts) in species richness, abundance indices of birds, and species-specific variation in counts between human BBS and ARU-based surveys conducted on-road and at the forest edge at different dates and times of day. We also generated on-road effective detection radius (EDR) estimates for 15 species and tested for species-specific differences in EDR to explain bias in counts between on-road and forest-edge ARU surveys. Overall, species richness and abundance indices in human BBS surveys were higher than forest-edge ARU surveys conducted simultaneously and when similar forest-edge ARU surveys were conducted at sunset and a week earlier in June. However, there was no difference when comparing values from human BBS with on-road ARU BBS and forest-edge ARU surveys conducted at sunrise. Extracting the maximum count per species from 4 types of 3-minute forest-edge surveys increased counts by 62% and 64% for species richness and abundance indices, respectively, relative to human BBS, but the importance of this bias differed considerably among the 10 most common species in the study area. Our results suggest that false-negative bias in species detection could be corrected with appropriate methods, and ARUs deployed at the forest edge near BBS stops could be used to increase data quality of on-road surveys. When combined with appropriate correction factors to adjust for surveys done at the forest edge, ARUs could also be used to increase the geographic coverage of boreal surveys by allowing inexperienced volunteers to collect BBS data along winter or secondary roads in remote locations.","[Pankratz, Rhiannon F.; Hache, Samuel] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sackville, NB, Canada; [Solymos, Peter] Univ Alberta, Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Solymos, Peter; Bayne, Erin M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Hache, S (corresponding author), POB 2310,5019-52nd St,4th Floor, Yellowknife, NT X1A 2P7, Canada.",Samuel.Hache@canada.ca,"Bayne, Erin/IUP-1777-2023; Solymos, Peter/B-2775-2008","Solymos, Peter/0000-0001-7337-1740",Environment and Climate Change Canada; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment and Climate Change Canada,Environment and Climate Change Canada; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment and Climate Change Canada,"We would like to thank Michelle Knaggs, Emily Upham-Mills, Danica Hogan, and Devon Versnick-Brown for their assistance in the field.

Managing invasive species is costly and complex, requiring input from biologists, decision makers, and the public. An informed and engaged public can play an important role in mitigating the negative effects of invasive avian species. However, little is known regarding the publics' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors toward non-native bird species. We examined the association between participating in a citizen science project and enjoyment, knowledge, and management of two non-native avian species in North America: European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We administered a pre and post survey to 947 people who monitor nest boxes in the United States and Canada, 30% of whom were also reporting their observations to NestWatch, a citizen science project focused on nesting birds. We found that NestWatch participants were more likely to have negative views of non-native species, score higher on bird identification tasks, and manage for invasive species than non-participants. The most important predictor for undertaking management activities was respondents' perceptions of whether they believed non-native birds to be a problem at the continental scale, underscoring the important role of individual factors such as perception. Our study also highlights the important role citizen science may play in shaping attitudes and behaviors and increasing knowledge. We propose a conceptual model describing the mechanisms by which citizen science can be leveraged for management of invasive species.","[Phillips, Tina B.; Bailey, Robyn L.; Martin, Vicki; Faulkner-Grant, Holly; Bonter, David N.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Phillips, TB (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",tina.phillips@cornell.edu,"Martin, Vicki/J-2131-2019; Martin, Victoria/J-4634-2016; Bonter, David/H-1313-2013","Bailey, Robyn/0000-0002-5298-3710; Martin, Victoria/0000-0003-3492-9240; Bonter, David/0000-0003-1768-1941",Cornell Lab of Ornithology,Cornell Lab of Ornithology,Funding provided by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.,NA,93,17,19,7,41,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,NA,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Recovery objectives for Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) include attainment of minimum population sizes within specified recovery units, as determined by two U.S. and two Canadian recovery teams. To assess progress toward these goals, complete surveys of the species' winter and breeding ranges in Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas, and the Greater Antilles are conducted every 5 years. In 1996, 1200 biologists and volunteers participated in the second International Piping Plover Census, tallying 2515 wintering birds and 5913 adults (2668 breeding pairs) during the breeding census. Winter numbers were 27% lower than those of the first international census conducted in 1991, with substantially fewer wintering birds along the Gulf of Mexico and an overall increase in numbers along the Atlantic Coast. Large numbers of wintering plovers remain undetected. In 1996, the total number of breeding adults was 7.7% higher than in 1991. Regionally, breeding numbers were 31% higher along the Atlantic Coast and 20% higher in the small Great Lakes population, but declined by 5% in the U.S. Great Plains and the Canadian Prairie. Target recovery numbers were met only for Saskatchewan but were approached in Alberta and New England.

This study investigates how a boundary analysis framework can be used to characterize the spatial association between boundaries (i.e., spatial locations of high rates of change) in bird species' distributions and landscape features at the regional scale. The study area covers 92,000 km(2) in southern Ontario (Canada) and extends from the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence biome to the southern Canadian Shield biome. Landcover composition was derived from Ontario Land Cover data (1991-1998; 7 types) and elevation data were derived from the Canada3D digital elevation model. Bird distributions were estimated using indicator kriging based on point counts obtained from the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas data (2001-2005; 60 species). Boundaries were delineated for both data types using a 10 x 10 km cell resolution. Spatial boundary overlap statistics were used to quantify the spatial relationship between landscape features and bird boundaries and tested using a randomization procedure. There was significant positive association and spatial overlap between delineated landscape feature boundaries and bird boundaries. The number of spatially overlapping cells between the two boundary types was 67 out of 164 (41 %) and 76 % of cells were within 11.42 km of each other. These results were statistically significant (P < 0.001) and suggest a strong spatial relationship between high rates of change in landscape features and bird species' distributions at the regional scale. A boundary analysis framework could be used to identify boundary shifts in response to climate change and anticipate changes in species distributions.","[Polakowska, Aleksandra E.; Fortin, Marie-Josee] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; [Couturier, Andrew] Bird Studies Canada, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada",University of Toronto,"Polakowska, AE (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol Evolutionary Biol, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",aleks.polakowska@gmail.com,NA,NA,LB Collaborative; Ontario Trillium Foundation; Metcalf Foundation; Couchiching Conservancy; Bird Studies Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Federation of Ontario Naturalists; Ontario Field Ornithologists; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources,LB Collaborative; Ontario Trillium Foundation; Metcalf Foundation; Couchiching Conservancy; Bird Studies Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Federation of Ontario Naturalists; Ontario Field Ornithologists; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources,"Funding for this project was graciously provided by the LB Collaborative, which is supported by the Ontario Trillium Foundation, the Metcalf Foundation, and the Couchiching Conservancy.

These loons are not well monitored, but we gathered localized count data for three Arctic-nesting loons (Pacific loon Gavia pacifica, red-throated loon G. stellata, and yellow-billed loon G. adamsii) from multiple sources and estimated mean annual population change to estimate species-specific trends over varying time periods. Most breeding ground information between 1996 and 2022 suggested stable numbers for each species, although data were scarce for yellow-billed loon. Trends during the non-breeding season from 1966 to 2021 were estimated for red-throated and Pacific loons from the Christmas Bird Count, a citizen science general bird count, and suggested overall stable or increasing numbers, despite some substantial regional differences. Again, yellow-billed loon numbers were not captured well during the non-breeding season. Aerial winter waterfowl surveys on the east coast of North America (2008-2011, 2014) showed positive trends for red-throated loons for most locations north of 38 degrees latitude and stable trends elsewhere. The paucity of both breeding and non-breeding count data for yellow-billed loons is unfortunate, as this species is found in high numbers in fishing gear in the Arctic. Overall, the limited available data do not suggest that loon populations breeding in the Canadian Arctic have experienced extensive declines, but monitoring of yellow-billed loons should be a priority.","[Pollet, Ingrid L.; Gutowsky, Sarah E.; Mallory, Mark L.] Acadia Univ, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada; [Alisauskas, Ray T.; Kellett, Dana K.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X4, Canada; [Harvey, William] Maryland Dept Nat Resources, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA; [Lalla, Kristen M.; Smith, Paul A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Lefebvre, Josee] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Quebec City, PQ G1J 0C3, Canada; [Russell-Mercier, Jake] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada; [Provencher, Jennifer F.] ECCC, Ecotoxicol & Wildlife Hlth Div, Ottawa, ON K1S 6K2, Canada; [Silverman, Emily D.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Laurel, MD 20708 USA",Acadia University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service,"Pollet, IL (corresponding author), Acadia Univ, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada.",ipollet@yahoo.com,"Provencher, Jennifer/J-2839-2016; Pollet, Ingrid/O-5031-2019; Mallory, Mark/A-1952-2017","Pollet, Ingrid/0000-0001-7207-8294; Smith, Paul/0000-0001-9573-5218; Harvey, William/0009-0007-2519-0161; Lefebvre, Josee/0000-0001-8399-5776; Gutowsky, Sarah E./0000-0003-1711-4744; Kellett, Dana/0000-0002-9314-5043; Silverman, Emily/0000-0003-4943-1314; Lalla, Kristen/0000-0003-1422-0672",NA,NA,NA,NA,62,2,2,3,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0722-4060,1432-2056,NA,POLAR BIOL,Polar Biol.,OCT,47,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,1001,1012,NA,10.1007/s00300-024-03277-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-024-03277-2,NA,24-Jul,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,F8B1F,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:001261197800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Vaux's swifts (Chaetura vauxi) are small, long-distance migratory birds that are currently experiencing range-wide population declines, especially at the their northern range limit. Many studies attribute the Vaux's swift's population decline to a loss in nesting habitat; however, other potentially exacerbating factors, such as changes in insect composition and diet, remain unstudied. Here, we examine a similar to 26 year dietary archive of Vaux's swift guano to ask whether diet composition has changed over time. Vaux's swifts roost communally at the same roost sites each year when migrating, often within decommissioned brick chimneys. As a result, guano accumulates at the base of these roost sites, providing a chronostratified snapshot of the bird's historic diet. We obtained a vertical core sample from a Vaux's swift guano deposit in a chimney on Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. We symmetrically stratified the guano and assessed diet composition by visually analyzing egested arthropod exoskeletons, identifying them to order, and measuring delta N-15 signatures at each layer. Our 26-year data set revealed an increase in the ratio of Hemiptera to Coleoptera corresponding with an increase in delta N-15, suggesting a possible decline in diet quality through time because Hemipterans tend towards higher trophic status than Coleopterans, but are of less caloric value per capita. In addition, delta N-15 was significantly negatively correlated with an annual population index (Breeding Bird Survey). We suggest a reduction in diet quality may be contributing to the decline of Vaux's swift populations, and could be contributing to more declines in other aerial insectivore species.","[Pomfret, James K.; Reudink, Matthew W.] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, Canada; [Nocera, Joseph J.] Trent Univ, Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Kyser, T.

Effective management and recovery actions for species of conservation concern require accurate methods of monitoring species occurrence that limit the incidence of nondetection error (when a species is falsely recorded as absent when it is present). The Chimney Swift (Chaetura pelagica) is experiencing widespread population declines in North America, possibly, in part, because chimneys used for nesting or roosting are being capped or demolished. In particular, the presence of nesting swifts in a chimney can be difficult to determine, and thus, it is important to design survey protocols that limit the incidence of nondetection error. Here, we used data from Bird Studies Canada's Citizen Science program, Ontario SwiftWatch, and dynamic occupancy models to examine factors influencing the probability of detecting Chimney Swifts at nest sites. We found that the probability of detecting Chimney Swifts at nest chimneys decreased with increasing cloud cover. We also found some support suggesting that detection increased moderately with date over the course of the nesting period (June-July). Based on our findings, we recommend that surveys aiming to identify Chimney Swift nest sites in southern Ontario, Canada should be conducted for at least one hour under clear skies, and as late in the nesting period as possible. The results of this study will inform survey design to reduce the incidence of false negatives during chimney surveys for nest occupancy, and as a result, help reduce Chimney Swift nesting habitat disturbance and loss.","[Purves, Elisabeth F.; Falconer, C.

Since it is difficult to track the entire annual cycle for long-distance migrants, measurements from part of the cycle may provide insights into overall drivers. Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) in Canada have undergone steep and long-term population declines. Using Breeding Bird Survey data and breeding performance data collected at field sites in three regions across Canada, we examined long- and short-term Barn Swallow population trends in Canada, differences in breeding performance across regions, if average breeding performance measures or colony size predicted regional population growth rates and if local breeding performance is driven by density dependence and/or recruitment. We found that long-term negative population trends were generally stronger in the east and west, and weaker in central Canada. Short-term population trends were generally weakly negative or neutral. Average breeding performance and colony size were poor predictors of regional growth rates observed in the subsequent year. We found little support for density dependence affecting local breeding performance; however, local breeding success, presumably through subsequent recruitment of young, was positively correlated to changes in local colony size in the following year. Since we found juveniles recruited into colonies located in the same region, but no link between average breeding performance and estimated regional population trajectories, our results suggest that extrapolating from local-scale studies to broader populations is challenging, and other demographic rates (i.e., survival) may need to be considered. Overall, our study suggests that contemporary Barn Swallow populations are below carrying capacity in Canada, further suggesting that food limitation is not currently regulating populations. Further study is needed to understand what factors are limiting and regulating Barn Swallow populations in Canada, across the annual cycle.","[Put, Julia E.; Salvadori, Antonio; Smith, Adam C.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mitchell, Greg W.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mitchell, Greg W.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mahony, Nancy A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Costa, Jeffrey] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Imlay, Tara L.; Boynton, Chloe K.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Delta, BC, Canada; [Imlay, Tara L.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Bossuyt, Scott; Burness, Gary] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Boynton, Chloe K.; Lansdorp, Olga; Williams, Tony D.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Evans, Dean R.; Hobson, Keith A.; Kusack, Jackson W.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Lenske, Ariel K.; McClenaghan, Beverly] Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [McClenaghan, Beverly] Ctr Environm Genom Applicat, St John, NF, Canada; [Whittam, Rebecca] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sackville, NB, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Carleton University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Dalhousie University; Trent University; Simon Fraser University; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Trent University; Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Put, JE (corresponding author), 335 River Rd, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada.",julia.e.put@gmail.com,"Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019; Burness, Gary/ABB-4937-2020; Imlay, Tara/J-6599-2019; Kusack, Jackson/AAN-6276-2020","Kusack, Jackson/0000-0003-2417-8527; Imlay, Tara/0000-0001-9011-3217",Environment and Climate Change Canada,Environment and Climate Change Canada,We thank all field staff and volunteers that collected the reproductive performance data and the volunteers that collect data for the BBS.

This is especially true for the subspecies east of the Rocky Mountains (P. s. subis), which today nests almost exclusively in provisioned housing (birdhouses and hollow gourds) provided by citizen scientists. One benefit of provisioned housing is reduced nest-site competition with nonnative European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus) when managed by citizen scientists. Increased competition for nest sites and subsequently lower productivity due to declining management of available housing is speculated to be primary factors for their long-term declines. To assess whether managed housing promoted high nest-survival metrics, we used a 19-year database (1995-2013) of nest-check records provided by Project MartinWatch, a citizen science program of the Purple Martin Conservation Association. We compared nest ecology metrics and survival among housing and entrance-hole type to assess if specific provisioned housing or entrance-hole type increased clutch size or number of chicks fledged. Using 72,627 nests across 8 regions monitored by citizen scientists, our major findings were 1) nest survival was >85% among 8 regions in the eastern United States and Canada; and 2) clutch size and number of fledglings produced were slightly larger in natural and artificial gourds with entrances designed to exclude European starlings; but 3) housing and entrance-hole types were not important predictors of nest survival and clutch size had a small, inverse relationship with daily nest survival (beta(Clutch) = -0.002). Our results suggest managed housing is an important conservation tool based on previously undocumented high nest survival across the numerous artificial housing options. Our findings encourage the use of artificial and natural gourds with European starling-resistant entrance holes, but promotion of managed artificial housing of any type in North America is beneficial and strongly encouraged.

In this study, we tested our ability to predict the response of bird communities (128 species) to land-use changes in southern Quebec (similar to 483,100 km(2)) over the last 30 yr (between 1984-1989 and 2010-2014) by using species distribution models (299,302 occurrences in 30,408 locations) from a hindcasting perspective. Results were grouped by functional guilds to infer potential impacts on ecosystem services, and to relate model transferability (i.e., ability of our models to be generalized to other times and scales) to specific functional and life-history traits. Overall, our models were able to accurately predict, both in space and time, habitat suitability for 69% of species, especially for granivorous, nonmigrant, tree-nesting species, and species that are tied to agricultural areas under intensive use. These findings indicate that model transferability depends upon specific functional and life-history traits, providing further evidence that species' ecologies affect the ability of models to accurately predict bird distributions. Declining bird species were mostly short-distance migrants that were associated with open habitats (agricultural and nonproductive forest) with aerial insectivorous or granivorous diets, which may be related to agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Land-use changes were positive for some forest bird species that were mainly associated with mixed and deciduous forests, generalist diets and tree-nesting strategies. Yet cavity-nesting birds have suffered substantial reductions in their distributions, suggesting that cumulative effects of intensive logging and wildfires on mature forests pose a threat for forest-specialist species. Habitat suitability changes predicted by our coarse-scale species distribution models partially agreed with the long-term trends reported by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Our findings confirm land-use change as a key driving force for shaping bird communities in southern Quebec, together with the need to explicitly incorporate it into global change scenarios that better inform decision-makers on conservation and management.","[Regos, Adrian] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Zooloxia Xenet & Antropoloxia Fis, Campus Sur, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Regos, Adrian] Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources CIBIO InBIO, ECOCHANGE Grp, Campus Agr Vairao, Vairao, Portugal; [Imbeau, Louis] UQAT, IRF, Ctr Etud Foret, 445 Blvd Univ, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada; [Desrochers, Melanie; Leduc, Alain; Drapeau, Pierre] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Ctr Etud Foret, 141 Ave President Kennedy, Montreal, PQ H2X 1Y4, Canada; [Robert, Michel; Jobin, Benoit] Environm & Changement Climat Canada, Serv Canadien Faune, 801-1550 Ave Estimauville, Quebec City, PQ G1J 0C3, Canada; [Brotons, Lluis] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CEMFOR CTFC, InForest Joint Res Unit CSIC CTFC CREAF, Solsona, Spain; [Brotons, Lluis] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Brotons, Lluis] CSIC, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade do Porto; University of Quebec; University Quebec Abitibi-Temiscamingue; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Regos, A (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Zooloxia Xenet & Antropoloxia Fis, Campus Sur, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.;Regos, A (corresponding author), Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources CIBIO InBIO, ECOCHANGE Grp, Campus Agr Vairao, Vairao, Portugal.",adrian.regos@usc.es,"Imbeau, Louis/A-6642-2009; Regos, Adrian/M-5207-2014; Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009","Regos, Adrian/0000-0003-1983-936X; Imbeau, Louis/0000-0003-4111-8059; Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; Drapeau, Pierre/0000-0002-1115-2531",NEWFORESTS (EU Seventh Framework Programme) [PIRSES-GA-2013-612645]; FORESTCAST [CGL2014-59742]; NSERC-discovery grants; Xunta de Galicia [ED481B2016/084-0],NEWFORESTS (EU Seventh Framework Programme); FORESTCAST; NSERC-discovery grants(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),"This work was partly funded by the NEWFORESTS (EU Seventh Framework Programme, PIRSES-GA-2013-612645) and FORESTCAST (CGL2014-59742) projects, as well as NSERC-discovery grants to P.

Rich 2018,Are North American bird species' geographic ranges mainly determined by climate?,2018,5.667,1,BBS,BBS,volunteer,acknowledgements,1,J,"Rich, JL; Currie, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"Rich, Johnathan L.; Currie, David J.",NA,NA,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,avian distributions; breeding season; climate; macroecology; North America; Breeding Bird Survey; range placement; spatial autocorrelation,SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; TAXONOMIC GROUPS; CHANGE IMPACTS; LAND-COVER; MODELS; DISTRIBUTIONS; ENVELOPE; EUROPE; SHIFTS; ASSOCIATIONS,"Aim: It is commonly asserted that climate presents the primary constraint on species' geographic distributions, and that species' distributions should therefore shift to track changing climate. However, the evidence is surprisingly mixed about the causal link between species' distributions and climate. Correlations between distributions and climate may be indirect, reflecting influences of other spatially structured habitat variables (e.g., land cover) and/or population processes (e.g., dispersal). Here, we ask if species' geographic distributions are more strongly related to climate, or to other spatially structured variables. Location: The contiguous United States and southern Canada. Time period: 1990-2000. Major taxa studied: North American passerine birds. Methods: We used the breeding-season distributions of 19 widespread species of passerine birds whose breeding-season distributions fall entirely within the area sampled by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We related these distributions to temperature and precipitation, geographic coordinates, and the degree of occupation of neighboring sites by conspecifics. Two spatial scales were examined: the geographic location of species' ranges within North America, and site occupancy within species' ranges. We examine these relationships using generalized linear models, structural equation modeling, random forest models and spatial correlograms. Results: On average, geographic coordinates and a model of neighborhood occupancy outperform a simple climatic model. After controlling for geographic coordinates, species occupancy is poorly related to climate. Neighborhood occupancy accounts for the majority of variance captured by geographic coordinates within ranges, and more for the continental placement of ranges. On average, species' distributions are more strongly and more directly related to spatial coordinates, and neighborhood occupancy, than to climate. Main conclusions: Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that climate is the primary, direct determinant of species' geographic distributions. Rather, other spatially structured factors appear to be stronger determinants of both continental range placement and within-range distributions of this sample of North American birds.","[Rich, Johnathan L.; Currie, David J.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Gendron Hall,30 Marie Curie, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Currie, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Gendron Hall,30 Marie Curie, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",dcurrie@uottawa.ca,NA,"Currie, David J./0000-0002-4906-2363",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [003131-2012],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: 003131-2012",NA,73,13,15,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,NA,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Our objectives were to test for thresholds in species richness of forest-breeding birds in relation to deciduous, coniferous, mixed, and total forest cover in two landscapes varying in the amount of forest present, and to determine whether thresholds for each forest type were coincident within and among landscapes, and across two spatial scales. We used Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas data to calculate species richness of forest-breeding birds. Percent deciduous, coniferous, mixed, and total forest cover were determined in 250 m radius circles around survey locations (local scale) and for 10 x 10 km squares (landscape scale) in the fragmented, sparsely forested Mixedwood Plains ecozone and in the more continuously forested Ontario Shield ecozone. Best-fit models explaining variation in species richness were selected from candidate sets of models that included 1-6 variables in addition to segmented or linear terms for forest cover. Threshold models had support at the local and landscape scales, and for all forest types. Thresholds ranged from 4 to 45 % cover, being slightly higher in the more continuously forested landscape, and for more prevalent forest types. Thresholds can provide useful targets for conservation efforts, but it is crucial to recognize that habitat levels should be maintained above threshold values to avoid ecological degradation, and to address the habitat requirements of species with occupancy thresholds above those of the assemblage.","[Richmond, Sonya; Couturier, Andrew] Bird Studies Canada, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada; [Jenkins, Eva] Bird Studies Canada, Sackville, NB E4L 1G6, Canada; [Cadman, Mike] Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Richmond, S (corresponding author), Bird Studies Canada, 115 Front Rd,POB 160, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada.",srichmond@bsc-eoc.org,NA,NA,Bird Studies Canada; Environment Canada; Federation of Ontario Naturalists; Ontario Field Ornithologists; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Bird Studies Canada; Environment Canada(CGIAR); Federation of Ontario Naturalists; Ontario Field Ornithologists; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We would like to thank the official sponsors of the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (Bird Studies Canada, Environment Canada, Federation of Ontario Naturalists, Ontario Field Ornithologists, and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources) for making the data available.

Commonly, such schemes are constructed using environmental surrogates; however, their effectiveness with regard to community delineation has been questioned in previous studies. Here, we aim to assess multiple environmental regionalization schemes' ability to delineate avian communities and to evaluate these schemes against a regionalization scheme built using species data directly. Location British Columbia, Canada. Methods We employed a beta diversity metric using community data from the BC Breeding Bird Atlas in multiple analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) tests, to assess the ability of a number of environmental regionalization schemes to delineate species turnover. We also developed a new species-based scheme using kriged local beta diversity values and a thematic resolution optimized through ANOSIM testing, which was then evaluated against the previously tested schemes. Results All regionalization schemes delineated significant patterns in community structure, with the Bird Conservation Regions performing most similarly to the species-based regionalization. Regionalizations that required regions to be spatially contiguous outperformed non-contiguous regionalizations. Increasing thematic resolution (the number of regions within a regionalization) improved a regionalization's overall performance; however, regional redundancy also increased. Main conclusions We argue that environmental regionalizations can function as effective alternatives to species-based regionalizations, particularly in areas with poor availability of species data. Also, we conclude that spatially contiguous regionalizations are superior to non-contiguous ones for delineating distinct communities. Lastly, we demonstrate how thematic resolution represents a trade-off between overall regionalization performance and regional redundancy, and how differing thematic resolutions can be employed depending upon the goals of the user.","[Rickbeil, Gregory J.

British Columbia, CA). Between June 2013 and 2014, we collected 257,327 field-recordings from eight sites as part of the Gitga'at Ecological and Cultural Monitoring Program. Our goals were: (1) to develop an acoustic baseline in a portion of Gitga'at Territory prioritized by local decision-makers, (2) to advance Gitga'at research capacity through the collaborative and reflexive structure of our approach. We argue that reorienting ecological knowledge production as praxis-based Street Science'' benefits resource management, as well as academic and local community interests. Gitga'at oral histories (adawx), and laws (ayaawx) guided our application of soundscape ecology, including our use of the normalized difference soundscape index (NDSI). Our results suggest Gitga'at Territory is a diverse acoustic-ecological space with numerous site-specific features. Significant differences were found between recording sites, with the greatest amount of biological activity noted June and July. We also found that the frequency and intensity of anthropogenic noise (i.e., technophony) in the Territory is currently very low, suggesting a low degree of anthropogenic disturbance. We conclude that soundscape ecology is well-suited for collaboration with indigenous communities, provided it is 'attuned' to the complex terms of engagement that constitute cross-cultural research.

However, analysis at the stop level may provide information on finer-scale habitat affiliations of species within the broader landscape, as well as changes in species distribution over time. Though once abundant, the Newfoundland Gray-cheeked Thrush (Catharus minimus minimus) underwent a dramatic population collapse across most of the island during the 1980s and 1990s and today is most common in montane forests. The reason for this collapse is not well understood but introduced North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), which colonized most forested areas on the island below-400 m from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s, have been identified as a possible cause. To improve our understanding of changes in the elevational distribution of Gray-cheeked Thrushes, we compared stop-level BBS data from two periods. Our historic period from 1974-1984 corresponds with the initial expansion phase of introduced red squirrels, whereas that from 2000-2015 reflects a period during which the colonization of suitable habitat by squirrels was complete. We used 17 routes (850 stops) where the thrushes had been observed and there were at least 3 surveys completed during each period. Surveys during the 1970s and 1980s indicated that Gray-cheeked Thrushes were abundant at all elevations sampled by the BBS (0-450 m), with higher incidence below 100 m and above 300 m; in contrast, recent surveys indicate that the species is now essentially absent below 350 m. This finding highlights the value of historical stop-level BBS data for reconstructing changes in species distributions and is consistent with the hypothesis that red squirrels have adversely affected Newfoundland Gray-cheeked Thrushes.","[Robineau-Charette, Gabrielle; Whitaker, Darroch M.] Pk Canada, Gros Morne Natl Pk, Rocky Harbour, NF, Canada; [Warkentin, Ian G.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Environm Sci Program, Grenfell Campus, Corner Brook, NF, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland,"Robineau-Charette, G (corresponding author), Pk Canada, Gros Morne Natl Pk, Rocky Harbour, NF, Canada.",NA,"Warkentin, Ian/AGL-1942-2022","Warkentin, Ian/0000-0003-1205-6506",NA,NA,NA,NA,48,1,1,2,2,Resilience Alliance,Dedham,"231 Bussey St., Beckwith and Brown, Dedham, Massachusetts, UNITED STATES",0273-8570,1557-9263,NA,J FIELD ORNITHOL,J.

In North America, the conservation consortium Partners in Flight (PIF) has developed and implemented a data-driven species assessment process, at global and regional scales, based on quantitative vulnerability criteria. This species assessment process has formed the biological basis for PIF's continental and regional planning and has informed the ranking and legal listing of bird species for conservation protection by state, provincial, and national agencies in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. Because of its long time series, extensive geographic and species coverage, standardized survey methods, and prompt availability of results, the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) has been an invaluable source of data, allowing PIF to assign objective vulnerability scores calibrated across more than 460 landbird species. BBS data have been most valuable for assessing long-term population trends (PT score). PIF has also developed methods for estimating population size by extrapolating from BBS abundance indices, allowing the assignment of categorical population size (PS) scores for landbird species. At regional scales, BBS relative abundance indices have allowed PIF to assess the area importance (i.e. stewardship responsibility) of each Bird Conservation Region (BCR) for each species, using measures of both relative density and percent of total population in each BCR. Besides direct applicability to assessment scores, PIF has recently used BBS trend data to create new metrics of conservation urgency (e.g., 'half-life'), as well as for setting population objectives for tracking progress toward meeting conservation goals. Future directions include integrating BBS data with other sources (e.g., eBird) to assess additional species and nonbreeding season measures, working closely with BBS coordinators to expand surveys into Mexico, and providing assessment scores at implementation-relevant scales, such as for migratory bird joint ventures.","[Rosenberg, Kenneth V.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Blancher, Peter J.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Stanton, Jessica C.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, La Crosse, WI USA; [Panjabi, Arvind O.] Bird Conservancy Rockies, Brighton, CO USA",Cornell University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Rosenberg, KV (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",kvr2@cornell.edu,NA,"Stanton, Jessica/0000-0002-6225-3703",NA,NA,NA,NA,37,42,49,1,39,COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,NA,CONDOR,Condor,AUG,119,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,594,606,NA,10.1650/CONDOR-17-57.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-17-57.1,NA,NA,13,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,FD2XN,NA,"Green Submitted, Bronze",NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000407398200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data from a volunteer-based survey at stopover sites throughout Ontario were used to assess population trends of shorebirds over the period 1974-2009. Surveyors carried out 7,135 surveys of 258 sites and recorded 538,744 individuals of 43 shorebird species. Of 19 taxa for which trends were estimated, 17 appeared to be declining in abundance. Precision of the trend estimates was generally poor and only three declines Were significant alpha = 0.05. Total numbers of shorebirds recorded on surveys declined by four per cent per year, resulting in an estimated decrease in abundance of greater than 75% over the 35 years of observation. Rate of decline may be increasing for some species as declines for twelve species were larger for the period 1989-2009 vs. 1974-1989, and six species showed significant declines in the latter period whereas none did in the former period. Relating these declines in abundance at the surveyed sites to population declines is complicated by, several potential sources of survey bias including changes in turnover rates and in migration timing and distributions of the species. However, given that these results are consistent with those of other migration surveys as well as those on the breeding and the wintering grounds, the most parsimonious explanation remains a widespread decline in shorebird populations.

We quantified wing-feather molt extent and frequency of wing-feather replacement of the preformative molt for all 5 species, then used these data to test whether the preformative molt extent is influenced by breeding latitude and migration distance. Our dataset consisted of molt cards from a published dataset and 2 online photographic libraries. Due to the small number of sampled species, we applied a 3-way approach: (1) comparison of molt extent among species using a post hoc pair-wise t-test; (2) comparison of molt extent between migratory and sedentary species using phylogenetic ANOVA; (3) PGLS regression of molt extent on breeding latitude and on migration distance.

We applied hierarchical multi-species models to data from 31 bird species at 38 Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) stations to assess 10-year (2011-2020) demographic trends and responses to energy sector disturbance (human footprint proportion) in the Athabasca oil sands region of Alberta, Canada. Adult captures, productivity, and residency probability all declined over the study period, and adult apparent survival probability also tended to decline. Consistent with the hypothesis that habitat loss may be driving declines, trends in adult captures, productivity, and survival were all more negative at stations with larger increases in disturbance over the study period. Species associated with early seral stages were more commonly captured at more disturbed stations, while species typical of mature forests were more commonly captured at less disturbed stations. Productivity was positively correlated with disturbance within 5-km of stations after controlling for disturbance within 1-km of stations, suggesting the importance of earlier successional habitat for post-fledging birds in the larger landscape. Adult apparent survival showed relatively little response to disturbance; stresses experienced beyond the breeding grounds likely play a larger role in influencing survival. Residency probability was negatively related to disturbance within 1-km scale of stations and could reflect processes affecting the ability of birds to establish or maintain territories in disturbed landscapes. We conclude that successional habitats that result from natural regeneration or restoration in disturbed areas, as well as decreased future footprint through recovery of mature forests and limiting of new disturbances, will both be important components of efforts to reverse population declines and maintain bird populations in the region. Lay Summary center dot Habitat loss and disturbance can affect the demography and trends of bird populations. center dot We used avian monitoring data from 2011 to 2020 and anthropogenic disturbance data (human footprint) at two spatial scales (1-km and 5-km radius) from a network of bird-banding stations in the Athabasca oil sands region of Alberta, Canada, to assess trends in, and disturbance effects on, the abundance and demography of 31 breeding bird species. center dot Abundance and demographic parameters declined, and trends in abundance, productivity, and adult apparent survival were all more negative at sites with increasing footprint; thus, decreasing future human footprint through habitat recovery in reclaimed industrial areas and limiting of new industrial disturbances will be critical for efforts to reverse bird population declines. center dot Positive responses of an index of abundance (adult captures) and productivity of at least some species to disturbance at one or both spatial scales also suggest an important role for successional habitats that develop in the wake of disturbance as part of regional conservation efforts.","[Saracco, James F.; Pyle, Peter; Kaschube, Danielle R.] Inst Bird Populat, Petaluma, CA 94956 USA; [Kohler, Monica] Univ Alberta, Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Godwin, Christine M.; Foster, Kenneth R.] Owl Moon Environm Inc, Ft Mcmurray, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Saracco, JF (corresponding author), Inst Bird Populat, Petaluma, CA 94956 USA.",jsaracco@birdpop.org,"Saracco, James/H-6520-2019","Saracco, James/0000-0001-5084-1834",Syncrude Canada Ltd.; Hammerstone Infrastructure Materials Ltd.; Canadian Natural Resources Limited; Cenovus Energy; ConocoPhillips Canada Resources Corp.; Devon Energy; Husky Oil Operations Ltd.; Imperial Oil Ltd.; Suncor Energy Inc.; TOTAL EP Canada; CNOOC International; Oil Sands Developers Group; Oil Sands Monitoring Program,Syncrude Canada Ltd.; Hammerstone Infrastructure Materials Ltd.; Canadian Natural Resources Limited; Cenovus Energy; ConocoPhillips Canada Resources Corp.; Devon Energy; Husky Oil Operations Ltd.; Imperial Oil Ltd.; Suncor Energy Inc.; TOTAL EP Canada; CNOOC International; Oil Sands Developers Group; Oil Sands Monitoring Program,"This work was funded by Syncrude Canada Ltd., Hammerstone Infrastructure Materials Ltd., Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy, ConocoPhillips Canada Resources Corp., Devon Energy, Husky Oil Operations Ltd., Imperial Oil Ltd., Suncor Energy Inc., TOTAL E&P Canada, CNOOC International, The Oil Sands Developers Group, and The Oil Sands Monitoring Program.",NA,72,5,5,3,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,2732-4621,NA,ORNITHOL APPL,Ornithol.

We analyzed data for 122 species of North American birds for which data exist in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) database but are not routinely analyzed on the BBS Summary and Analysis Website. Many of these species occur in the northern part of the continent, on routes that fall outside the core survey area presently analyzed in the United States and southern Canada. Other species not historically analyzed occur in the core survey area with very limited data but have large portions of their ranges in Mexico and south. A third group of species not historically analyzed included species thought to be poorly surveyed by the BBS, such as rare, coastal, or nocturnal species. For 56 species found primarily in regions north of the core survey area, we expanded the scope of the analysis, using data from 1993 to 2014 during which >= 3 survey routes had been sampled in 6 northern strata (Bird Conservation regions in Alaska, Yukon, and Newfoundland and Labrador) and fitting log-linear hierarchical models for an augmented BBS survey area that included both the new northern strata and the core survey area. We also applied this model to 168 species historically analyzed in the BBS that had data from these additional northern strata. For both groups of species we calculated survey-wide trends for the both core and augmented survey areas from 1993 to 2014; for species that did not occur in the newly defined strata, we computed trends from 1966 to 2014. We evaluated trend estimates in terms of established credibility criteria for BBS results, screening for imprecise trends, small samples, and low relative abundance. Inclusion of data from the northern strata permitted estimation of trend for 56 species not historically analyzed, but only 4 of these were reasonably monitored and an additional 13 were questionably monitored; 39 of these species were likely poorly monitored because of small numbers of samples or very imprecisely estimated trends. Only 4 of 66 new'' species found in the core survey area were reasonably monitored by the BBS; 20 were questionably monitored; and 42 were likely poorly monitored by the BBS because of inefficiency in precision, abundance, or sample size. The hierarchical analyses we present provide a means for reasonable inclusion of the additional species and strata in a common analysis with data from the core area, a critical step in the evolution of the BBS as a continent-scale survey. We recommend that results be presented both 1) from 1993 to the present using the expanded survey area, and 2) from 1966 to the present for the core survey area. Although most of the new'' species we analyzed were poorly monitored by the BBS during 1993-2014, continued expansion of the BBS will improve the quality of information in future analyses for these species and for the many other species presently monitored by the BBS.","[Sauer, John R.; Niven, Daniel K.; Pardieck, Keith L.; Ziolkowski, David J., Jr.; Link, William A.] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, 12100 Beech Forest Rd, Laurel, MD 20708 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Sauer, JR (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, 12100 Beech Forest Rd, Laurel, MD 20708 USA.",jrsauer@usgs.gov,NA,"Niven, Daniel/0000-0002-3253-7211; Pardieck, Keith/0000-0003-2779-4392; Ziolkowski Jr., David/0000-0002-2500-4417",NA,NA,NA,NA,15,18,20,1,19,U S FISH & WILDLIFE SERVICE,SHEPHERDSTOWN,"NATL CONSERVATION TRAINING CENTER, CONSERVATION LIBRARY, 698 CONSERVATION WAY, SHEPHERDSTOWN, WV 25443 USA",1944-687X,NA,NA,J FISH WILDL MANAG,J.

Robbins for a continental-scale omnibus survey of breeding birds led to the development of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Chan was uniquely suited to develop the BBS. His position as a government scientist had given him experience with designing and implementing continental-scale surveys, his research background made him an effective advocate of the need for a survey to monitor pesticide effects on birds, and his prominence in the birding community gave him connections to infrastructure-a network of qualified volunteer birders who could conduct roadside surveys with standardized point counts. Having started in the eastern United States and the Atlantic provinces of Canada in 1966, the BBS now provides population change information for similar to 546 species in the continental United States and Canada, and recently initiated routes in Mexico promise to greatly expand the areas and species covered by the survey. Although survey protocols have remained unchanged for 50 years, the BBS remains relevant in a changing world. Several papers that follow in this Special Section of The Condor: Ornithological Advances review how the BBS has been applied to conservation assessments, especially in combination with other large-scale survey data. A critical feature of the BBS program is an active research program into field and analytical methods to enhance the quality of the count data and to control for factors that influence detectability. Papers in the Special Section also present advances in BBS analyses that improve the utility of this expanding and sometimes controversial survey. In this Perspective, we introduce the Special Section by reviewing the history of the BBS, describing current analyses, and providing summary trend results for all species, highlighting 3 groups of conservation concern: grassland-breeding birds, aridland-breeding birds, and aerial insectivorous birds.","[Sauer, John R.; Pardieck, Keith L.; Ziolkowski, David J., Jr.; Niven, Daniel K.; Link, William A.] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; [Smith, Adam C.; Hudson, Marie-Anne R.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Rodriguez, Vicente; Berlanga, Humberto] Mexican Natl Commiss Knowledge & Use Biodivers, Delgacion Tlalpan, DF, Mexico",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Sauer, JR (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA.",jrsauer@usgs.gov,"; Rodriguez, Vicente/C-9389-2012","Smith, Adam Clark/0000-0002-2829-4843; Pardieck, Keith/0000-0003-2779-4392; Ziolkowski Jr., David/0000-0002-2500-4417; Niven, Daniel/0000-0002-3253-7211; Rodriguez, Vicente/0000-0002-8812-6841",NA,NA,NA,NA,37,185,228,5,82,COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,NA,CONDOR,Condor,AUG,119,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,576,593,NA,10.1650/CONDOR-17-83.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-17-83.1,NA,NA,18,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,FD2XN,NA,"Bronze, Green Submitted",NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000407398200018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Annual analyses of the survey produce estimates of trend and annual indexes of abundance for 25 states and provinces, management regions, and survey-wide. In recent years, researchers have used a log-linear hierarchical model that defines year effects as random effects in the context of a slope parameter (the S model) to model population change. Recently, researchers have proposed alternative models suitable for analysis of singing-ground survey data. Analysis of a similar roadside survey, the North American Breeding Bird Survey, has indicated that alternative models are preferable for almost all species analyzed in the Breeding Bird Survey. Here, we use leave-one-out cross-validation to compare model fit for the present singing-ground survey model to fits of three alternative models, including a model that describes population change as the difference in expected counts between successive years (the D model) and two models that include t-distributed extra-Poisson overdispersion effects (H models) as opposed to normally distributed extra-Poisson overdispersion. Leave-one-out cross-validation results indicate that the Bayesian predictive information criterion favored the D model, but a pairwise t-test indicated that the D model was not significantly better-fitting to singing-ground survey data than the S model. The H models are not preferable to the alternatives with normally distributed overdispersion. All models provided generally similar estimates of trend and annual indexes suggesting that, within this model set, choice of model will not lead to alternative conclusions regarding population change. However, as in Breeding Bird Survey analyses, we note a tendency for S model results to provide slightly more extreme estimates of trend relative to D models. We recommend use of the D model for future singing-ground survey analyses.","[Sauer, John R.; Link, William A.] US Geol Survey, Eastern Environm Sci Ctr, 12100 Beech Forest Rd, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; [Seamans, Mark E.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Migratory Bird Management, Lakewood, CO 80225 USA; [Rau, Rebecca D.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Migratory Bird Management, Laurel, MD 20708 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service,"Sauer, JR (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Eastern Environm Sci Ctr, 12100 Beech Forest Rd, Laurel, MD 20708 USA.",jrsauer@usgs.gov,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12,2,2,1,9,U S FISH & WILDLIFE SERVICE,SHEPHERDSTOWN,"NATL CONSERVATION TRAINING CENTER, CONSERVATION LIBRARY, 698 CONSERVATION WAY, SHEPHERDSTOWN, WV 25443 USA",1944-687X,NA,NA,J FISH WILDL MANAG,J.

Power analyses on FBMP data indicated that fur species occurring at 50 sites, 10 yr of annual sampling at either three or five locations (stations) per sampling Site would provide adequate (80%) power to monitor declines in annual counts of 2-3% (18-26% decline over 10 yr). Obtaining this level of power for species found at fewer than 50 sites requires more time, The FBMP method of two visits to each site per year seems appropriate.

Using records of more than 4.3 million birds observed by volunteers from March to May 2017-2020 across Canada and the United States, we found that counts of 66 (80%) of 82 focal bird species changed in pandemic-altered areas, usually increasing in comparison to prepandemic abundances in urban habitat, near major roads and airports, and in counties where lockdowns were more pronounced or occurred at the same time as peak bird migration. Our results indicate that human activity affects many of North America's birds and suggest that we could make urban spaces more attractive to birds by reducing traffic and mitigating the disturbance from human transportation after we emerge from the pandemic.","[Schrimpf, Michael B.; Sanchez-Jasso, Jessica; Warrington, Miyako H.; Koper, Nicola] Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Des Brisay, Paulson G.; Smith, Adam C.; Robinson, Barry G.; Mahony, Nancy A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Des Brisay, Paulson G.; Smith, Adam C.; Robinson, Barry G.; Mahony, Nancy A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Des Brisay, Paulson G.; Smith, Adam C.; Robinson, Barry G.; Mahony, Nancy A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Johnston, Alison; Strimas-Mackey, Matthew] Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY USA; [Horn, Andrew G.] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Fahrig, Lenore] Carleton Univ, Geomat & Landscape Ecol Res Lab, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Manitoba; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Cornell University; Dalhousie University; Carleton University,"Koper, N (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",nicola.koper@umanitoba.ca,"Warrington, Miya/AFR-8822-2022; Jasso, Jessica/HOF-4451-2023; Fahrig, Lenore/C-6494-2012; Schrimpf, Michael/JJC-8063-2023; Robinson, Barry/O-4406-2014; Johnston, Alison/N-4820-2016","Schrimpf, Michael/0000-0001-7001-1440; Mahony, Nancy/0000-0001-9138-0480; Robinson, Barry/0000-0002-2646-2508; Johnston, Alison/0000-0001-8221-013X; Koper, Nicola/0000-0003-3576-9525; Smith, Adam Clark/0000-0002-2829-4843; Warrington, Miyako/0000-0003-2699-1167; Sanchez-Jasso, Jessica Mariana/0000-0002-9621-9423; Des Brisay, Paulson/0000-0003-2684-292X; Strimas-Mackey, Matthew/0000-0001-8929-7776",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Alliance COVID-19 grant [ALLRP 550721-20]; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Cornell Lab of Ornithology,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Alliance COVID-19 grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Environment and Climate Change Canada; Cornell Lab of Ornithology,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Alliance COVID-19 grant ALLRP 550721-20.

Here, we use two decades of daily citizen science monitoring to characterize day-to-day variation in building collisions and determine the factors that predict the highest risk times in two North American cities. We use these analyses to evaluate three potential causes of increased collision risk: heightened migration traffic during benign weather, increased navigational and flight errors during inclement weather, and increased errors in response to highly directional sunlight that enhances reflected images. The seasonal phenology of collisions was consistent across sites and years, with daily collision rates approximately twofold higher in autumn as compared to spring. During both migration seasons, collision risk was best predicted by the weather conditions at dawn. In spring, peak collision risk occurs on days with warm temperatures, south winds, and a lack of precipitation at dawn. In autumn, peak collision occurs on days with cool temperatures, north winds, high atmospheric pressure, a lack of precipitation, and clear conditions with high visibility. Based on these results, we hypothesize that collisions are influenced by two main weather-driven mechanisms. First, benign weather at dawn and winds that are favorable for migration cause an increase in migration traffic in both spring and autumn, creating greater opportunity for collisions to occur. Second, for autumnal migrants, cold clear conditions may cause an additional increase in collision risk. We propose that these conditions may be particularly hazardous in autumn because of the high abundance of naive and diurnal migrants at that time of year. Our analysis also establishes that a relatively small proportion of days (15%) are responsible for 50% of the total collision mortality within a season, highlighting the importance of targeting mitigation strategies to the most hazardous times.","[Scott, Kara M.

However, our understanding of how climate-induced changes in habitat and weather patterns will influence habitat suitability remains poorly understood, particularly for species at high latitudes or elevations. Here, we assessed potential future distributions for a climate-sensitive genus, Lagopus, and the effectiveness of protected areas in tracking shifting distributions. Location British Columbia, Canada. Methods Using community science observations from 1970 to 2020, we built species distribution models for white-tailed (L. leucura), rock (L. muta) and willow ptarmigan (L. lagopus) across British Columbia, a globally unique region harbouring all three ptarmigan species. We assessed the impact of climate (direct) and climate-induced habitat change (indirect) on potential future distributions of ptarmigan. Results White-tailed and rock ptarmigan were associated with colder temperatures and tundra-like open habitats and willow ptarmigan with open, shrub habitats. Future projections based on climate and vegetation scenarios indicated marked losses in suitable habitat by the 2080s (RCP +8.5 W/m(2)), with range declines of 85.6% and 79.5% for white-tailed and rock ptarmigan, respectively, and a lower 61.3% for willow ptarmigan. Predicted current and future suitable habitat occurred primarily outside of current protected areas (67%-82%), yet range size declined at a less pronounced rate within protected areas suggesting a capacity to buffer habitat loss. Main conclusions Ptarmigan are predicted to persist at higher elevations and latitudes than currently occupied, with the magnitude of elevation shifts consistent with trends observed elsewhere in the Holarctic. Our spatially explicit assessment of potential current and future distributions of ptarmigan species provides the first comprehensive evaluation of climate change effects on the distribution of three congeneric, cold-adapted species with different habitat preferences and life-history traits. We also highlight the potential role of protected areas in preserving suitable future sites for ptarmigan and other climate-sensitive or high-elevation species.","[Scridel, Davide; de Zwaan, Devin R.; Froese, Nick; Wilson, Scott; Martin, Kathy] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Scridel, Davide; Brambilla, Mattia; Pedrini, Paolo] Museo Sci, Sez Zool Vertebrati, Corso Sci Lavoro, Trento, Italy; [Scridel, Davide] Ist Superiore Protezi & Ric Ambientale ISPRA, Area Avifauna Migratrice, Rome, Italy; [Wilson, Scott; Martin, Kathy] Pacific Wildlife Res Ctr, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Delta, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Pacific Wildlife Research Centre,"Scridel, D (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",dscridel@gmail.com,"Scridel, Davide/B-3110-2016; Wilson, Scott/AAC-7144-2021; de Zwaan, Devin R./L-4628-2016","Scridel, Davide/0000-0003-3849-1178; Martin, Kathy/0000-0002-5386-7105; de Zwaan, Devin R./0000-0001-5418-0754; Brambilla, Mattia/0000-0002-7643-4652; Wilson, Scott/0000-0002-1210-8727",University of British Columbia (UBC); MUSE (Museo delle Scienze Trento Italy; Climate and environmental change scheme); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Northern Scientific Training Program; Environment and Climate Change Canada; UBC,University of British Columbia (UBC); MUSE (Museo delle Scienze Trento Italy; Climate and environmental change scheme); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Northern Scientific Training Program; Environment and Climate Change Canada; UBC,"We are grateful to the outdoor enthusiasts throughout B.C. who submitted ptarmigan sightings to KM and DS over the past decades.

Methods Using community science observations from 1970 to 2020, we built species distribution models for white-tailed (L. leucura), rock (L. muta) and willow ptarmigan (L. lagopus) across British Columbia, a globally unique region harbouring all three ptarmigan species. We assessed the impact of climate (direct) and climate-induced habitat change (indirect) on potential future distributions of ptarmigan. Results White-tailed and rock ptarmigan were associated with colder temperatures and tundra-like open habitats and willow ptarmigan with open, shrub habitats. Future projections based on climate and vegetation scenarios indicated marked losses in suitable habitat by the 2080s (RCP +8.5 W/m(2)), with range declines of 85.6% and 79.5% for white-tailed and rock ptarmigan, respectively, and a lower 61.3% for willow ptarmigan. Predicted current and future suitable habitat occurred primarily outside of current protected areas (67%-82%), yet range size declined at a less pronounced rate within protected areas suggesting a capacity to buffer habitat loss. Main conclusions Ptarmigan are predicted to persist at higher elevations and latitudes than currently occupied, with the magnitude of elevation shifts consistent with trends observed elsewhere in the Holarctic. Our spatially explicit assessment of potential current and future distributions of ptarmigan species provides the first comprehensive evaluation of climate change effects on the distribution of three congeneric, cold-adapted species with different habitat preferences and life-history traits. We also highlight the potential role of protected areas in preserving suitable future sites for ptarmigan and other climate-sensitive or high-elevation species.","[Scridel, Davide; de Zwaan, Devin R.; Froese, Nick; Wilson, Scott; Martin, Kathy] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Scridel, Davide; Brambilla, Mattia; Pedrini, Paolo] Museo Sci, Sez Zool Vertebrati, Corso Sci Lavoro, Trento, Italy; [Scridel, Davide] Ist Superiore Protezi & Ric Ambientale ISPRA, Area Avifauna Migratrice, Rome, Italy; [Wilson, Scott; Martin, Kathy] Pacific Wildlife Res Ctr, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Delta, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Pacific Wildlife Research Centre,"Scridel, D (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",dscridel@gmail.com,"Scridel, Davide/B-3110-2016; Wilson, Scott/AAC-7144-2021; de Zwaan, Devin R./L-4628-2016","Scridel, Davide/0000-0003-3849-1178; Martin, Kathy/0000-0002-5386-7105; de Zwaan, Devin R./0000-0001-5418-0754; Brambilla, Mattia/0000-0002-7643-4652; Wilson, Scott/0000-0002-1210-8727",University of British Columbia (UBC); MUSE (Museo delle Scienze Trento Italy; Climate and environmental change scheme); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Northern Scientific Training Program; Environment and Climate Change Canada; UBC,University of British Columbia (UBC); MUSE (Museo delle Scienze Trento Italy; Climate and environmental change scheme); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Northern Scientific Training Program; Environment and Climate Change Canada; UBC,"We are grateful to the outdoor enthusiasts throughout B.C. who submitted ptarmigan sightings to KM and DS over the past decades.

Specifically, using citizen science birdsong databases, we test whether chipping sparrow, Spizella passerina, song is geographically structured on a continental scale. The chipping sparrow is a particularly well-suited species for this study, since individuals have a simple song of one repeated syllable, have only the beginning of their first breeding season to adjust their song before crystallization and have been shown to match their song to a nearby neighbour while establishing their first territory. If most chipping sparrows adopt a neighbour-matching strategy, we might expect local syllable similarity; in contrast, field studies have shown that local syllable diversity has been maintained over time. We analyse 820 individual recordings of the simple, yet diverse, song of chipping sparrows to assess whether long-range geographical patterns have formed despite this local song variation. We found significant correlations between song features and geographical distance, associated with longitude but not latitude: chipping sparrows in the eastern United States and Canada sing at a slower rate (fewer, longer syllables) than the western population. However, comparing individual syllable types between regions, we found diverse song types persist across this species' range. To better contextualize our findings, we re-evaluate available genetic sequences of chipping sparrows to test for genetic differentiation between the eastern and western populations in which we found song differences.

Understanding the mechanisms influencing the initial colonization and persistence of invaders is therefore needed if conservation actions are to prevent new invasions or strive to slow their spread. The Eurasian Collared-Dove (Streptopelia decaocto, EUCO) is one of the most successful avian invasive species in North America; however, to our knowledge, no study has simultaneously examined the role that climate-matching, human activity, directional propagation, and local density have in this invasion process. Our research expands upon a cellular-automata-based hierarchical model developed to assess directional invasion dynamics to further quantify the impacts of climate, elevation, and land cover type on the spread of EUCO in North America. Our results suggest that EUCO's dispersal patterns can largely be explained by the effects of habitat, climate, and environmental conditions at different stages of the invasion process rather than some innate preferred north-westerly spread. Specifically, EUCO initially colonized warm and wet grassland habitats and tended to persist in urban areas. We also found that while EUCO were more likely to spread to the northeast of existing habitats, directional preference did not drive persistence and recolonization events. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating both neighborhood effects and environmental factors in the modelling of range-expanding species, adding to the toolset available to researchers to model invasive species spread. Further, our research demonstrates that historical records of invasive species occurrences can provide the data resources needed to disentangle the characteristics driving species invasion and enable predictions that are of critical importance to resource managers. center dot The Eurasian Collared-Dove is an invasive species in North America. Starting from the Bahamas in 1974, it has colonized much of the U.S. and Canada.center dot The Eurasian Collared-Dove tended to spread to the northwest, and previous studies suggested that this was due to an innate preference for this direction. However, these studies did not consider that this might also be explained by habitat selection.center dot We studied the Eurasian Collared-Dove's range expansion using data from the Project Feeder Watch citizen science study. Our findings suggest that they prefer grasslands and thrive in areas with higher temperatures, more precipitation, and higher elevations, with little regard for direction.center dot These results add to our understanding of the invasion process of the Eurasian Collared-Dove in North America, and broadly highlight the importance of historical records to disentangle the characteristics driving species invasion that are important to resource managers. The new methods can also be applied to understand the spread of other invasive species. La biodiversite mondiale est de plus en plus menacee par la propagation d'especes envahissantes. Il est donc necessaire de comprendre les mecanismes qui influencent la colonisation initiale et la persistance des envahisseurs si l'on veut que les mesures de conservation empechent de nouveaux envahissements ou ralentissent leur propagation. Streptopelia decaocto est l'une des especes aviaires envahissantes ayant le plus de succes en Amerique du Nord; toutefois, a notre connaissance, aucune etude n'a examine simultanement le role de l'adaptation au climat, de l'activite humaine, de la propagation directionnelle et de la densite locale dans ce processus d'envahissement. Nos recherches s'appuient sur un modele hierarchique a base d'automates cellulaires developpe pour evaluer la dynamique d'envahissement directionnel afin de quantifier les impacts du climat, de l'altitude et du type d'occupation du sol sur la propagation de S. decaocto en Amerique du Nord. Nos resultats suggerent que les patrons de dispersion de S. decaocto peuvent etre largement expliques par les effets de l'habitat, du climat et des conditions environnementales a differents stades du processus d'envahissement plutot que par une preference innee pour une propagation vers le nord-ouest. Plus precisement, S. decaocto a d'abord colonise des habitats de prairies chaudes et humides et a eu tendance a persister dans les zones urbaines. Nous avons egalement constate que si S. decaocto etait plus susceptible de se propager au nord-est des habitats existants, la preference directionnelle ne determinait pas les evenements de persistance et de recolonisation. Ces resultats soulignent l'importance d'incorporer a la fois les effets de voisinage et les facteurs environnementaux dans la modelisation des especes qui etendent leur aire de repartition, ajoutant ainsi a la panoplie d'outils disponibles dont disposent les chercheurs pour modeliser la propagation des especes envahissantes. En outre, nos recherches demontrent que les mentions historiques de presence d'especes envahissantes peuvent fournir les donnees necessaires pour demeler les caracteristiques qui regissent l'envahissement des especes et permettre des predictions qui sont d'une importance critique pour les gestionnaires de ressources.","[Shao, Yiran; Bonner, Simon J.] Western Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON, Canada; [Ethier, Danielle M.] Birds Canada, Port Rowan, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Bonner, SJ (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON, Canada.",sbonner6@uwo.ca,NA,"Ethier, Danielle/0000-0003-2191-9633; Bonner, Simon/0000-0003-2063-4572; Shao, Yiran/0000-0002-7007-6161",National Science and Engineering Research Council [RGPIN-2016-04432]; Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute,National Science and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute,Simon Bonner is supported through a Discovery Grant through the National Science and Engineering Research Council (RGPIN-2016-04432) and through a Collaborative Research Team Award from the Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute.,NA,47,0,0,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,2732-4621,NA,ORNITHOL APPL,Ornithol.

Potential causes include the spread of West. Nile virus (WNV), increases in populations of Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii), and loss of suitable habitat. We examined trends in the numbers of both migratory and resident kestrel populations that Use nest boxes in eight study areas in Florida, Georgia, Virginia and Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon Territory, 1984-2007. All eight populations underwent significant declines; the mean annual decline in nest-box occupancy rate was 3.0% and ranged from 0.6% in Pennsylvania to 4.7% in New Jersey. Except for the most recent nest-box program, established in 1995 and declining since 2002, all nest-box populations began to experience declines before WNV arrived in North America in 1999. To test whether changes in kestrel population densities generally are associated with the opposite trend in Cooper's Hawks, we examined the 42 BBS physiographic regions for which trends for both species were available. No significant correlations were detected for the period 1966-2007, or for 1980-2007, more closely concurrent with Our nest-box data. Christmas Bird Count data front 1959 through 1988 also failed to demonstrate a significant correlation. Finally, the habitat within our study areas still appears suitable, and die remaining kestrels appear healthy and have high reproductive success. Thus, the principal cause of die decline probably lies elsewhere, perhaps on the wintering grounds or along migration routes. Further, for both migratory and resident. populations, the decline in nest-box occupancy may reflect regional declines, which would reduce the number of individuals available for replacing breeding birds that have died or dispersed.","[Smallwood, John A.] Montclair State Univ, Dept Biol & Mol Biol, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Mossop, David H.] Yukon Coll, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 4H5, Canada; [Klucsarits, James R.] Alvernia Coll, Reading, PA 19607 USA; [Melvin, Richard J.] Amer Kestrel Fdn, High Springs, FL 32655 USA; [Dawson, Russell D.] Univ No British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Bortolotti, Gary R.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [Parrish, John W., Jr.; Breen, Timothy F.] Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Boyd, Kenneth] US Army Corps Engn, Clarks Hill, SC 29821 USA",Montclair State University; Yukon University; Alvernia University; University of Northern British Columbia; University of Saskatchewan; University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC),"Smallwood, JA (corresponding author), Montclair State Univ, Dept Biol & Mol Biol, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",smallwoodj@montclair.edu,NA,NA,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Georgia DNR; Arcadia Wildlife Preserve, Inc; Nongaine Program; Florida Game and Fresh water Fish Commission; Margaret and Herman Sokol Faculty/Student Research; Separately Budgeted Research Awards; Montclair State University; Faculty Scholarship Program; MSU","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Georgia DNR; Arcadia Wildlife Preserve, Inc; Nongaine Program; Florida Game and Fresh water Fish Commission; Margaret and Herman Sokol Faculty/Student Research; Separately Budgeted Research Awards; Montclair State University; Faculty Scholarship Program; MSU","We thank the multitude of field assistants who helped to collect data. especially K.L.

Potential causes include the spread of West. Nile virus (WNV), increases in populations of Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii), and loss of suitable habitat. We examined trends in the numbers of both migratory and resident kestrel populations that Use nest boxes in eight study areas in Florida, Georgia, Virginia and Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon Territory, 1984-2007. All eight populations underwent significant declines; the mean annual decline in nest-box occupancy rate was 3.0% and ranged from 0.6% in Pennsylvania to 4.7% in New Jersey. Except for the most recent nest-box program, established in 1995 and declining since 2002, all nest-box populations began to experience declines before WNV arrived in North America in 1999. To test whether changes in kestrel population densities generally are associated with the opposite trend in Cooper's Hawks, we examined the 42 BBS physiographic regions for which trends for both species were available. No significant correlations were detected for the period 1966-2007, or for 1980-2007, more closely concurrent with Our nest-box data. Christmas Bird Count data front 1959 through 1988 also failed to demonstrate a significant correlation. Finally, the habitat within our study areas still appears suitable, and die remaining kestrels appear healthy and have high reproductive success. Thus, the principal cause of die decline probably lies elsewhere, perhaps on the wintering grounds or along migration routes. Further, for both migratory and resident. populations, the decline in nest-box occupancy may reflect regional declines, which would reduce the number of individuals available for replacing breeding birds that have died or dispersed.","[Smallwood, John A.] Montclair State Univ, Dept Biol & Mol Biol, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Mossop, David H.] Yukon Coll, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 4H5, Canada; [Klucsarits, James R.] Alvernia Coll, Reading, PA 19607 USA; [Melvin, Richard J.] Amer Kestrel Fdn, High Springs, FL 32655 USA; [Dawson, Russell D.] Univ No British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Bortolotti, Gary R.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [Parrish, John W., Jr.; Breen, Timothy F.] Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Boyd, Kenneth] US Army Corps Engn, Clarks Hill, SC 29821 USA",Montclair State University; Yukon University; Alvernia University; University of Northern British Columbia; University of Saskatchewan; University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC),"Smallwood, JA (corresponding author), Montclair State Univ, Dept Biol & Mol Biol, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",smallwoodj@montclair.edu,NA,NA,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Georgia DNR; Arcadia Wildlife Preserve, Inc; Nongaine Program; Florida Game and Fresh water Fish Commission; Margaret and Herman Sokol Faculty/Student Research; Separately Budgeted Research Awards; Montclair State University; Faculty Scholarship Program; MSU","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Georgia DNR; Arcadia Wildlife Preserve, Inc; Nongaine Program; Florida Game and Fresh water Fish Commission; Margaret and Herman Sokol Faculty/Student Research; Separately Budgeted Research Awards; Montclair State University; Faculty Scholarship Program; MSU","We thank the multitude of field assistants who helped to collect data. especially K.L.

Smith 2022,Hierarchical Bayesian integrated model for estimating migratory bird harvest in Canada,2022,2.3,1,NHS,NHS,none,none,0,J,"Smith, AC; Villeneuve, T; Gendron, M",NA,NA,NA,"Smith, Adam C.; Villeneuve, Thomas; Gendron, Michel",NA,NA,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bayesian; Canada; harvest; hierarchical; JAGS; murre; open-science; recreational hunting; waterfowl,WATERFOWL; PRODUCTIVITY; ABUNDANCE; RATIO,"The Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) requires reliable estimates of the harvest of migratory game birds, including waterfowl, to effectively manage populations of these hunted species. The National Harvest Survey is an annual survey of hunters who purchase Canada's mandatory migratory game bird hunting permit, integrating information from a survey of hunting activity with information from a separate survey of species composition in the harvest. We used these survey data to estimate the number of birds harvested for each species and hunting activity metrics (e.g., number of active hunters, days spent hunting). The analytical methods used to generate these estimates have not changed since the survey was first designed in the early 1970s. We describe a new hierarchical Bayesian integrated model, which replaces the series of ratio estimators that comprised the old model. We are using this new model to generate estimates for migratory bird harvests as of the 2019-2020 hunting season, and to generate updated estimates for all earlier years. The hierarchical Bayesian model uses over-dispersed Poisson distributions to model mean hunter activity and harvest (zero-inflated Poisson and zero-truncated Poisson, respectively). It also includes multinomial distributions to model some key components (e.g., variation in harvest across periods of the hunting season, the species composition of the harvest within each of those periods, the age and sex composition in the harvests of a given species). We estimated the parameters of the Poisson and the multinomial distributions for each year as random effects using first-difference time-series. This time-series component allows the model to share information across years and reduces the sensitivity of the estimates to annual sampling noise. The new model estimates are generally very similar to those from the old model, particularly for the species that occur most commonly in the harvest, so the results do not suggest any major changes to harvest management decisions and regulations. Estimates for all species from the new model are more precise and less susceptible to annual sampling error, particularly for species that occur less commonly in the harvest (e.g., sea ducks, other species of conservation concern). This new model, with its hierarchical Bayesian framework, will also facilitate future improvements and elaborations, allowing the incorporation of prior information from the rich literature and knowledge in game bird management and biology.","[Smith, Adam C.; Villeneuve, Thomas; Gendron, Michel] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Canadian Wildlife Serv, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada,"Smith, AC (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Canadian Wildlife Serv, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada.",adam.smith@ec.gc.ca,NA,"Smith, Adam Clark/0000-0002-2829-4843",NA,NA,NA,NA,38,10,11,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-541X,1937-2817,NA,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

More than half of the species were estimated to have lost >50% of their abundance. Furthermore, estimated rates of decline have accelerated during the last three generations for most species.

The standard trend models for the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) were designed to estimate changes in relative abundance through time (trend) within broad geographic strata, such as countries, Bird Conservation Regions, U.S. states, and Canadian territories or provinces. Calculating trend estimates at the level of the BBS's individual survey transects (routes) allows exploration of finer spatial patterns and estimation of the effects of covariates, such as habitat loss or annual weather, on both relative abundance and trend. Here, we describe four related hierarchical Bayesian models that estimate trends for individual BBS routes. All four models estimate route-level trends and relative abundances using a hierarchical structure that shares information among routes, and three of the models share information in a spatially explicit way. The spatial models use either an intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive (iCAR) structure or a distance-based Gaussian Process (GP) to estimate the spatial components. We fit all four models to data for 71 species and then, because of the intensive computations required, fit two of the models (one spatial and one non-spatial) for an additional 216 species. In a leave-future-out cross-validation, the spatial models outperformed the non- spatial models for 284 out of 287 species. The best approach to modeling the spatial components depends on the species being modeled; the Gaussian Process had the highest predictive accuracy for 69% of the species tested here and the iCAR was better for the remaining 31%. We also present two examples of route-level covariate analyses focused on spatial and temporal variation in habitat for Rufous Hummingbird ( Selasphorus rufus) and Horned Grebe ( Podiceps auritus). In both examples, the inclusion of covariates improved our understanding of the patterns in the rate of population change for both species. Route-level models for BBS data are useful for visualizing spatial patterns of population change, generating hypotheses on the causes of change, comparing patterns of change among regions and species, and testing hypotheses on causes of change with relevant covariates.","[Smith, Adam C.; Aponte, Veronica I.; Cox, Amelia R.; Daly, Lindsay; Edwards, Brandon P.

Avian conservationists have relied on population estimates from Partners in Flight (PIF), which primarily uses roadside data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). However, the BBS was not designed to estimate population sizes. Therefore, we set out to compare the PIF approach with spatially explicit models incorporating roadside and off-road point-count surveys. We calculated population estimates for 81 landbird species in Bird Conservation Region 6 in Alberta, Canada, using land cover and climate as predictors. We also developed a framework to evaluate how the differences between the detection distance, time-of-day, roadside count, and habitat representation adjustments explain discrepancies between the 2 estimators. We showed that the key assumptions of the PIF population estimator were commonly violated in this region, and that the 2 approaches provided different population estimates for most species. The average differences between estimators were explained by differences in the detection-distance and timeof-day components, but these adjustments left much unexplained variation among species. Differences in the roadside count and habitat representation components explained most of the among-species variation. The variation caused by these factors was large enough to change the population ranking of the species. The roadside count bias needs serious attention when roadside surveys are used to extrapolate over off-road areas. Habitat representation bias is likely prevalent in regions sparsely and non-representatively sampled by roadside surveys, such as the boreal region of North America, and thus population estimates for these regions need to be treated with caution for certain species. Additional sampling and integrated modeling of available data sources can contribute towards more accurate population estimates for conservation in remote areas of North America.","[Solymos, Peter; Toms, Judith D.; Matsuoka, Steven M.; Cumming, Steven G.; Barker, Nicole K.

Selecting a subset of species that do not frequent bird feeders and have >= 25% range overlap with the distribution of CBC circles (228 species) we further estimated aggregate (i.e., across species) trends for the entire study region and at the level of states/provinces, Bird Conservation Regions, and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. Moreover, we examined the relationship between ten biological traits-range size, population size, migratory strategy, habitat affiliation, body size, diet, number of eggs per clutch, age at sexual maturity, lifespan, and tolerance of urban/suburban settings-and CBC trend estimates. Our results indicate that 68% of the 551 species had increasing trends within the study area over the interval 1966-2013. When trends were examined across the subset of 228 species, the median population trend for the group was 0.9% per year at the continental level. At the regional level, aggregate trends were positive in all but a few areas. Negative population trends were evident in lower latitudes, whereas the largest increases were at higher latitudes, a pattern consistent with range shifts due to climate change. Nine of 10 biological traits were significantly associated with median population trend; however, none of the traits explained >34% of the deviance in the data, reflecting the indirect relationships between population trend estimates and species traits. Trend estimates based on the CBC are broadly congruent with estimates based on the North American Breeding Bird Survey, another large-scale monitoring program. Both of these efforts, conducted by citizen scientists, will be required going forward to ensure robust inference about population dynamics in the face of climate and land cover changes.","[Soykan, Candan U.; Schuetz, Justin G.] Natl Audubon Soc, Conservat Sci, 220 Montgomery St,Suite 1000, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA; [Sauer, John] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, 12100 Beech Forest Rd, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; [LeBaron, Geoffrey S.; Dale, Kathy] Natl Audubon Soc, Citizen Sci, 2300 Comp Ave,I-49, Willow Grove, PA 19090 USA; [Langham, Gary M.] Natl Audubon Soc, 1200 18th St NW,Suite 500, Washington, DC 20036 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Soykan, CU (corresponding author), Natl Audubon Soc, Conservat Sci, 220 Montgomery St,Suite 1000, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA.",cbc@audubon.org,NA,"Langham, Gary/0009-0002-9479-6806",NA,NA,NA,NA,53,58,64,1,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,NA,NA,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,MAY,7,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,e01351,10.1002/ecs2.1351,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1351,NA,NA,16,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DN6VS,NA,gold,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000377215200042,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two methods of determining the cause of death of seabirds encountered during surveys of beaches of southwestern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, are compared. Birds were either subjected to external visual examinations by volunteer beach surveyors or submitted for gross postmortem examination by a verterinarian. The reliance on external examination of birds on beaches often prevented the accurate classification of the reproductive status and cause of death of the birds collected, but was valuable for describing the species, locations, and numbers of birds affected. The use of gross postmortem examinations of carcasses allowed for a more refined classification of the cause of death, as well as providing reliable descriptions of the bodily condition and sex of the birds examined. However, almost one half of the carcasses encountered were unsuitable for necropsy because of scavenging and decomposition. It is concluded that a combination of field and necropsy observations provides a useful method with which to monitor the pattern of mortality of beached seabirds.","UNIV SASKATCHEWAN,WESTERN COLL VET MED,DEPT VET MICROBIOL,SASKATOON S7N 0W0,SASKATCHEWAN,CANADA; UNIV VICTORIA,DEPT BIOL,VICTORIA V8W 2Y2,BC,CANADA",University of Saskatchewan; University of Victoria,NA,NA,"Stephen, Craig/HNJ-6213-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12,6,11,0,4,CANADIAN VET MED ASSOC,OTTAWA,"339 BOOTH ST ATTN: KIMBERLY ALLEN-MCGILL, OTTAWA ON K1R 7K1, CANADA",0008-5286,NA,NA,CAN VET J,Can.

One such error was Brisson's (1760) original naming of the species as the Brown Jay of Canada. Another was Ridgway's (1899) naming of the Gray Jay as a new subspecies, Perisoreus (canadensis) griseus, through inappropriate comparison of fresh grey specimens with old brown ones. We discovered that browning of initially grey plumage also occurs between annual moults in living individuals of the Canada Jay's Pacific morphotype. We documented this change using photographs and re-sightings of colour-banded individuals and through spectral analysis of year-old (brown) and incoming (grey) rectrices collected from the same moulting individuals. To assess the distribution of this colour change, we compared September vs. May eBird photographs from across North America. We showed that seasonal colour change is normal in the Pacific morphotype but rare in the two other morphotypes.

By contrast, marsh birds (bitterns, rails, grebes) are declining, despite this group appearing to benefit from many of the same conservation actions applied for waterfowl. To help understand this dichotomy, we 1) assessed land cover habitat associations for breeding marsh birds and priority waterfowl in eastern Canada at a broad range of spatial scales, and 2) compared these results between guilds - using data collected by the Maritimes Marsh Monitoring Program of Birds Canada. As we observed variation both within and between these groups, managers will do well to take species-specific or life-history-based approaches to wetland conservation and landscape management. Nonetheless, we offer guild-level generalizations that capture the majority of the effects on occupancy for the species we analyzed in our study area. We found that occupancy of both groups was higher in protected wetlands (e.g., in parks, land trusts) and at wetlands influenced by water control structures; however, marsh birds may benefit more than waterfowl from water level control. Occupancy by both groups increased with increasing amounts of water and wetland in the surrounding landscape, but this was more pronounced and included a greater variety of wetland types at broader spatial scales for marsh birds compared to waterfowl. Some marsh birds showed negative associations with urban land use and none had strong relationships with agriculture, yet occupancy of nearly all waterfowl increased with either urban or agricultural land cover. Actions that will benefit both groups include conserving large wetland complexes interspersed with, and surrounded by, low and intermediate amounts of urban and agricultural land use, respectively. A greater understanding of habitat use by wetland bird species helps construct sustainable working landscapes that benefit both birds and people.","[Studholme, Katharine R.; Tranquilla, Laura McFarlane; Berrigan, Lucas E.; Achenbach, Laura M.] Birds Canada Sackville, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Tozer, Douglas C.] Birds Canada Port Rowan, Port Rowan, ON, Canada",NA,"Studholme, KR (corresponding author), 17 Waterfowl Lane, Sackville, NB E4L 1G6, Canada.",krstudholme@smcm.edu,NA,NA,Birds Canada; Environment and Climate Change Canada; New Brunswick Wildlife Trust Fund; New Brunswick Department of Natural Energy and Resource Development; Ducks Unlimited Canada; Nature Trust of New Brunswick; Nature Conservancy of Canada; Canada Summer Jobs; Prince Edward Island Conservation Fund; Wildlife Habitat Canada; National Wetland Conservation Fund,Birds Canada; Environment and Climate Change Canada; New Brunswick Wildlife Trust Fund; New Brunswick Department of Natural Energy and Resource Development; Ducks Unlimited Canada; Nature Trust of New Brunswick; Nature Conservancy of Canada; Canada Summer Jobs; Prince Edward Island Conservation Fund; Wildlife Habitat Canada; National Wetland Conservation Fund,"Financial support for this study, including fieldwork and data analysis, was from Birds Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, New Brunswick Wildlife Trust Fund, New Brunswick Department of Natural Energy and Resource Development, Ducks Unlimited Canada, Nature Trust of New Brunswick, the Nature Conservancy of Canada, Canada Summer Jobs, Prince Edward Island Conservation Fund, Wildlife Habitat Canada, and National Wetland Conservation Fund.

The occurrence of these species, however, is influenced by the surrounding landscape. To aid decision-makers, we used data from the Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program of Birds Canada at 521 sites across four time periods (2000-2001, 2005-2006, 2010-2011, 2015-2016) throughout southern Ontario, Canada, to quantify how initial occupancy and subsequent local extinction or colonization of 13 marsh-breeding bird indicator species (or species groups) was influenced by the composition of, and concurrent changes in, surrounding remotely-sensed land cover within 200- 6,400 m. For six species (46 %) initial occupancy was higher or extinction was lower where surrounding wetland/open water land cover was higher. By contrast, initial occupancy was lower, extinction was higher, and/or colonization was lower: 1) where surrounding anthropogenic (predominantly urban) land cover was higher (four species, 31 %), 2) in Great Lakes coastal compared to inland landscapes (five species, 38 %), and 3) where loss of surrounding wetland/open water land cover increased, depending on whether surrounding wetland/open water land cover was initially low or high (seven species, 54 %). We recommend that decision-makers consider the influence of the surrounding landscape during conservation planning and when measuring success of wetland restorations based on marsh-breeding bird indicator species, particularly in Great Lakes coastal landscapes and landscapes with high urban land cover and/or low wetland/open water land cover. & COPY; 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

We used band recovery data and isotopic composition of primary (P1) and secondary (S13) feathers to estimate population sources and connectivity among natal, early fall, and winter ranges of hunter-harvested juvenile American woodcock. We used P1 feathers from known-origin pre-fledged woodcock (n = 43) to create a hydrogen delta H-2(f) isoscape by regressing delta H-2(f) against expected growing-season precipitation (d2Hp). Modeled delta H-2(p) values explained 79% of the variance in P1 delta H-2(f) values, indicating good model fit for estimating woodcock natal origins. However, a poor relationship (r(2) = 0.23) between known-origin, S13 delta H-2(f) values, and expected delta H-2(p) values precluded assignment of early fall origins. We applied the delta H-2(f) isoscape to assign natal origins using P1 feathers from 494 hunter-harvested juvenile woodcock in the United States and Canada during 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 hunting seasons. Overall, 64% of all woodcock origins were assigned to the northernmost (>44 degrees N) portion of both the Central and Eastern Management Regions. In the Eastern Region, assignments were more uniformly distributed along the Atlantic coast, whereas in the Central Region, most woodcock were assigned to origins within and north of the Great Lakes region. We compared our origin assignments to spatial coverage of the annual American woodcock Singing Ground Survey (SGS) and evaluated whether the survey effectively encompasses the entire breeding range. When we removed the inadequately surveyed Softwood shield Bird Conservation Region (BCR) from the northern portion of the SGS area, only 48% of juvenile woodcock originated in areas currently surveyed by the SGS. Of the individuals assigned to the northernmost portions of the breeding range, several were harvested in the southern extent of the wintering range. Based upon this latitudinal winter stratification, we examined whether woodcock employed a leapfrog migration strategy. Using delta H-2(f) values and band-recovery data, we found some support for this migration strategy hypothesis but not as a singular explanation. The large harvest derivation of individuals from the northernmost portions of the breeding range, and the difference in breeding distributions within each Management Region should be considered in future range-wide conservation and harvest management planning for American woodcock.

We used P1 feathers from known-origin pre-fledged woodcock (n = 43) to create a hydrogen delta H-2(f) isoscape by regressing delta H-2(f) against expected growing-season precipitation (d2Hp). Modeled delta H-2(p) values explained 79% of the variance in P1 delta H-2(f) values, indicating good model fit for estimating woodcock natal origins. However, a poor relationship (r(2) = 0.23) between known-origin, S13 delta H-2(f) values, and expected delta H-2(p) values precluded assignment of early fall origins. We applied the delta H-2(f) isoscape to assign natal origins using P1 feathers from 494 hunter-harvested juvenile woodcock in the United States and Canada during 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 hunting seasons. Overall, 64% of all woodcock origins were assigned to the northernmost (>44 degrees N) portion of both the Central and Eastern Management Regions. In the Eastern Region, assignments were more uniformly distributed along the Atlantic coast, whereas in the Central Region, most woodcock were assigned to origins within and north of the Great Lakes region. We compared our origin assignments to spatial coverage of the annual American woodcock Singing Ground Survey (SGS) and evaluated whether the survey effectively encompasses the entire breeding range. When we removed the inadequately surveyed Softwood shield Bird Conservation Region (BCR) from the northern portion of the SGS area, only 48% of juvenile woodcock originated in areas currently surveyed by the SGS. Of the individuals assigned to the northernmost portions of the breeding range, several were harvested in the southern extent of the wintering range. Based upon this latitudinal winter stratification, we examined whether woodcock employed a leapfrog migration strategy. Using delta H-2(f) values and band-recovery data, we found some support for this migration strategy hypothesis but not as a singular explanation. The large harvest derivation of individuals from the northernmost portions of the breeding range, and the difference in breeding distributions within each Management Region should be considered in future range-wide conservation and harvest management planning for American woodcock.

A number of statistical methods have been used to estimate population trends, but there is no consensus as to which is the most reliable. We quantified differences in trend estimated trends for 115 species in British Columbia using three analysis methods: U.S. National Biological Service rout regression, Canadian Wildlife Service route regression, and nonparametric rank-trends analysis. Overall, the number of species estimated to be declining was similar among the three methods, but the number of statistically significant declines was not similar (15, 8, and 29 respectively). In addition, many differences existed among methods in the trend estimates assigned to individual species. Comparing the two route regression methods, Canadian Wildlife Service estimates had a greater absolute magnitude on average than those of the U.S. National Biological Service method. U.S. National Biological Service estimates were on average more positive than the Canadian Wildlife Service estimates when the respective agency's data selection criteria were applied separately. These results imply that our ability to detect population declines and to prioritize species of conservation concern depend strongly upon the analysis method used. This highlights the need for further research to determine how best to accurately estimate trends from the data. We suggest a method for evaluating the performance of the analysis methods by using simulated Breeding Bird Survey data.","CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV, PACIFIC WILDLIFE RES CTR, DELTA, BC V4K 3N2, CANADA",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Pacific Wildlife Research Centre,"Thomas, L (corresponding author), UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, FAC FORESTRY, CTR APPL CONSERVAT BIOL, 270-2357 MAIN HALL, VANCOUVER, BC V6T 1Z4, CANADA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,55,45,56,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0888-8892,NA,NA,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Surveillance of WNv included testing of corvids found dead and reported by citizens across Ontario, which at the time was a novel citizen science application for disease surveillance. While this surveillance program was successful for timely identification of WNv as it emerged and spread across the province, it is important to consider the influence of non-disease factors on surveillance data collected by the public. The objective of this study was to examine associations between rates of citizen phone reports of dead corvids and sociodemographic factors within the geographic areas where the reports were obtained. The data were grouped by forward sortation area (FSA), a geographical area based upon postal codes, which was linked with census data. Associations between the weekly rate of citizen reports and FSA-level sociodemographic factors were measured using multilevel negative binomial models. There were 12,295 phone call reports of dead corvids made by citizens in 83.3% of Ontario FSAs. Factors associated with the weekly rate of phone reports included the proportion of high-rise housing, the proportion of households with children, the proportion of seniors in the population, the proportion of citizens with no knowledge of either official language and the latitude of the FSA. There were higher rates of citizen phone reports in FSAs with <80% high-rise housing and greater proportions of households with children. A positive and negative association in the rate of calls with the proportion of seniors and latitude of the FSA, respectively, were moderated by the proportion of the population with knowledge of official language(s). Understanding the sociodemographic characteristics associated with citizen reporting rates of sentinels for disease surveillance can be used to inform advanced cluster detection methods such as applying the spatial scan test with normal distribution on residuals from a regression model to reduce confounding. In citizen-derived data collected for disease surveillance, this type of approach can be helpful to improve the interpretation of cluster detection results beyond what is expected.","[Thomas-Bachli, Andrea L.; Pearl, David L.; Parmley, E.

From 1995-2002, average May, June, and July water levels in all lake basins showed some annual variation, but Lakes Erie and Huron-Michigan had identical annual fluctuation patterns and general water level declines. No trend was observed in Lake Ontario water levels over this period. Abundance for five of seven marsh birds in Lake Ontario wetlands showed no temporal trends, whereas abundance of black tern (Chlidonias niger) declined and that of swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) increased from 1995-2002. In contrast, abundances of American coot (Fulica americana), black tern, common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), marsh wren (Cistorthorus palustris), pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), sora (Porzana carolina), swamp sparrow, and Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) declined within marshes at Lakes Erie and Huron/Michigan from 1995-2002. Annual abundances of several birds we examined showed positive correlations with annual lake level changes in non-regulated Lakes Erie and Huron/Michigan, whereas most birds we examined in Lake Ontario coastal wetlands were not correlated with suppresed water level changes of this lake. Overall, our results suggest that long-term changes and annual water level fluctuations are important abiotic factors affecting abundance of some marsh-dependent birds in Great Lakes coastal marshes. For this reason, wetland bird population monitoring initiatives should consider using methods in sampling protocols, or during data analyses, to account for temporal and spaitial components of hydrologic variability that affect wetlands and their avifauna.","[Badzinski, Shannon S.] Bird Studies Canada, Long Point Waterfowl & Wetlands Res Fund, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada; [Ingram, Joel W.] Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Timmermans, STA (corresponding author), Golder Associates, 210 Sheldon Dr,2nd Floor, Cambridge, ON L5N 5Z7, Canada.",steve_timmermans@golder.com,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,60,40,60,2,61,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2205 COMMONWEALTH BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48105 USA",0380-1330,NA,NA,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

These were used to translate harvesters' reporting units into numbers of animals by species (cords for fuelwood), and then to whole and edible weights. The total harvest was 84.5 tonnes of edible meat or 0.342 kg per day for each of the 676 residents. Three tonnes of berries and 682 cords of fuelwood were harvested. The village's gross income for the survey period is assessed and a dollar value assigned to the harvest. The bush harvest (income-in-kind and commodities) accounted for one-third of total village income, which contradicts the prevalent stereotype that resources from the land do not significantly contribute to the Pinehouse economy.",NA,NA,"TOBIAS, TN (corresponding author), UNIV WATERLOO,WATERLOO N2L 3G1,ONTARIO,CANADA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36,11,14,0,8,ARCTIC INST N AMER,CALGARY,"UNIV OF CALGARY 2500 UNIVERSITY DRIVE NW 11TH FLOOR LIBRARY TOWER, CALGARY AB T2N 1N4, CANADA",0004-0843,NA,NA,ARCTIC,Arctic,SEP,47,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,207,221,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,15,"Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,PJ508,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:A1994PJ50800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Processes influencing population trends have been shown to vary between the edge and the core of a species' range. Here, we examined shifts in occurrence and abundance of a declining species, the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), toward the northern edge of its breeding range over two to three decades. We examined those shifts at both coarse (breeding-bird atlases) and fine (individual forest fragments) spatial scales in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. We hypothesized that populations would be less stable at the periphery of the range than in the core, as a result of combined effects of lower habitat quality and lower immigration rates in the periphery. At the fine spatial scale in the core of the Canadian distribution, we predicted that populations would show turnovers between years, but occurrence would remain stable at the landscape scale. As expected, Wood Thrush occurrence remained relatively stable in fragmented forests in the core of the breeding range (at both coarse and fine spatial scales), in contrast to peripheral regions. The influence of mature forest cover varied between ecoregions and spatial scales. The instability of coarse-scale occurrence patterns in peripheral versus core populations is consistent with the prediction that large-scale declines are more likely to be detected at the periphery of a species' range. However, populations declined within the core as well, albeit at a lower rate. The greater stability of core populations probably results from higher habitat quality and higher immigration rates. Yet, local recruitment within the core is expected to be low, owing to the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on productivity documented elsewhere.","[Torrenta, Remi] Birds Canada, Delta, BC V4K 2T9, Canada; [Hobson, Keith A.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Hobson, Keith A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Tozer, Douglas C.] Birds Canada, Port Rowan, ON, Canada; [Villard, Marc-Andre] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski,"Torrenta, R (corresponding author), Birds Canada, Delta, BC V4K 2T9, Canada.",rtorrenta@birdscanada.org,"Torrenta, Rémi/ABD-6629-2021; Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019; Villard, Marc-André/ISR-7944-2023",NA,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Birds Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Canadian Wildlife Service (Ontario Region); Bourses Acadie-France,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Birds Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Canadian Wildlife Service (Ontario Region); Bourses Acadie-France,"This research was supported by a discovery grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to M.-A.

We examined relationships between Common Loon reproductive success and longitude, year, lake area, and pH across southern Canada using data collected from 1992 to 2010 by participants in Bird Studies Canada's Canadian Lakes Loon Survey. Our goal was to indirectly describe the health of lakes in southern Canada with respect to mercury and acid precipitation. The overall model-predicted number of six-week-old young per pair per year was 0.59 (95% confidence limits: 0.56-0.62). Six-week-old young per pair per year decreased by 0.19 from west-to-east (-127 degrees to -52 degrees longitude), decreased by 0.14 between 1992 and 2010, increased by 0.22 as lake area increased from 10 to 3000 ha, and increased by 0.43 as acidity decreased from pH 5 to 9. The relationships were likely linked to acid-and temperature-mediated exposure to methylmercury and/or acid-induced reductions in forage fish. The temporal decrease was unexpectedly steeper in southwestern than in southeastern Canada. Projections suggested that reproductive success across southern Canada may not drop below the demographic source-sink threshold until similar to 2016 (range: 2009-2029). Reproductive success on pH 6.0 lakes, however, may have passed below the source-sink threshold as early as similar to 2001 (1995-2009), whereas reproductive success on pH 8.0 lakes may not pass below the threshold until similar to 2034 (2019-2062). There were similar to 0.1 more six-week-old young per pair per year on 2500 ha lakes than on 20 ha lakes. Reproductive success crossed below the source-sink threshold on 20 ha lakes at pH 6.4 (5.8-7.1) and on 2500 ha lakes at pH 5.5 (4.1-6.6). Our results show that citizen science is powerful for monitoring ecosystem health and indirectly support further action to abate emissions of mercury and the harmful components of acid precipitation throughout North America and globally.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CLLS by the TD Friends of the Environment Foundation; Kenneth M.

I accounted for differences in detection probability, addressed spatial autocorrelation, and assessed whether initial occupancy in 1996 and subsequent colonization or extinction at a site within and across species was influenced by site, wetland, and landscape scale covariates. Occupancy of 9 of 15 (60%) species significantly decreased, whereas occupancy of only 1 (7%) species significantly increased. The results show the power of citizen science and suggest that the largest number of decreasing marsh-dependent breeding bird species will benefit from conserving, restoring, or creating large wetlands surrounded by limited urban land use, and from addressing issues within International Joint Commission Areas of Concern. Plus, individual or smaller groups of decreasing species will also benefit from conserving, restoring, or creating robust-emergent-dominated but interspersed, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria)-free, Phragmites-free wetlands surrounded by higher proportions of wetland cover in the surrounding landscape, and from addressing issues within Great Lakes coastal wetlands. These actions will help promote colonization or reduce extinction and help slow or maybe even reverse declining trends in occupancy among decreasing species across the southern portion of the Great Lalces basin.

Therefore, it is important to develop regional field survey protocols that maximize detections, but that also produce data for estimating and analytically adjusting for remaining differences in detections. We aimed to improve regional field survey protocols by estimating detection probability of eight elusive marsh bird species throughout two regions that have ongoing marsh bird monitoring programs: the southern Canadian Prairies (Prairie region) and the southern portion of the Great Lakes basin and parts of southern Quebec (Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region). We accomplished our goal using generalized binomial N-mixture models and data from similar to 22,300 marsh bird surveys conducted between 2008 and 2014 by Bird Studies Canada's Prairie, Great Lakes, and Quebec Marsh Monitoring Programs. Across all species, on average, detection probability was highest in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region from the beginning of May until mid-June, and then fell throughout the remainder of the season until the end of June; was lowest in the Prairie region in mid-May and then increased throughout the remainder of the season until the end of June; was highest during darkness compared with light; and did not vary significantly according to temperature (range: 0-30 degrees C), cloud cover (0%-100%), or wind (0-20 kph), or during morning versus evening. We used our results to formulate improved marsh bird survey protocols for each region. Our analysis and recommendations are useful and contribute to conservation of wetland birds at various scales from local single-species studies to the continental North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Program.","[Tozer, Douglas C.; Drake, Kiel L.; Falconer, C.

Prior to this protocol, some monitoring programs used point counts with broadcasts during the first 5 min of 10-min counts, and have since used 15-min counts with an initial 5-min passive period (P-1) followed by 5 min of broadcasts (B) and a second 5-min passive period (P-2) to ensure consistency across years and programs. Influence of timing of broadcasts within point counts and point count duration, however, have rarely been assessed. Using data from 23,973 broadcast-assisted 15-min point counts conducted throughout the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region between 2008 and 2016 by Bird Studies Canada's Marsh Monitoring Program and Central Michigan University's Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program, we estimated detection probabilities of individuals for 14 marsh breeding bird species during P1B compared to BP2, P-1 compared to P-2, and P1B compared to P-1 BP2. For six broadcast species and American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), we found no significant difference in detection during P1B compared to BP2, and no significant difference in four of the same seven species during P-1 compared to P-2. We observed small but significant differences in detection for 7 of 14 species during P1B compared to P1BP2. We conclude that differences in timing of broadcasts causes no bias based on counts from entire 10-minute surveys, although P1B should be favored over BP2 because the same amount of effort in P1B avoids broadcast bias in all broadcast species, and 10-min surveys are superior to 15-min surveys because modest gains in detection of some species does not warrant the additional effort. We recommend point counts consisting of 5 min of passive observation followed by broadcasts, consistent with the standardized marsh bird protocol, for surveying marsh breeding birds.","[Tozer, Douglas C.; Falconer, C.

However, the assumption that conservation actions for waterfowl also benefit other wildlife is rarely quantified. We modeled detection and occupancy of species at sites within 42 conservation project wetlands compared to sites within 52 similar nearby unmanaged wetlands throughout southern Ontario, Canada, and small portions of the adjacent U.S., using citizen science data collected by Bird Studies Canada's Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program, including 2 waterfowl and 13 non-waterfowl marsh-breeding bird species (n=413 sites) and 7 marsh-breeding frog species (n=191 sites). Occupancy was significantly greater at conservation project sites compared to unmanaged sites in 7 of 15 (47%) bird species and 3 of 7 (43%) frog species, with occupancy being higher by a difference of 0.12-0.38 across species. Notably, occupancy of priority conservation concern or at-risk Black Tern (Chlidonias niger), Common Gallinule (Gallinula galeata), Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), Sora (Porzana carolina), and Western Chorus Frog (Pseudacris triseriata) was significantly higher at conservation project sites compared to unmanaged sites. The results demonstrate the utility of citizen science to inform wetland conservation, and suggest that actions under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan are effective for conserving non-waterfowl species.

To advance conservation of these species, we used occupancy modeling, a regional prioritization scheme, and data from Birds Canada's Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program (2016-2018) to describe species-habitat relationships and identify priority habitat areas for 7 obligate marsh-breeding bird species in southern Ontario, Canada: American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), common gallinule (Gallinula galeata), least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris), pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), sora (Porzana carolina), and Virginia rail (Rallus limicola). Given these species respond to land cover at widely varying spatial scales, we initially identified the most informative scale (buffer = 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, 800 m, 1,600 m, 3,200 m, or 6,400 m) for marsh, urban, agricultural, and forest cover to increase model performance. We also considered climate variables, whether sample sites were along a Great Lakes coastline or inland, and covariates influencing detection. Occupancy was best explained by land cover at a wide range of spatial scales depending on the species. All species except Virginia rail responded positively to marsh cover; American bittern and Virginia rail responded negatively to urban cover; least bittern, pied-billed grebe, and Virginia rail responded negatively and sora responded positively to agricultural cover; and American bittern, common gallinule, marsh wren, and pied-billed grebe responded negatively and Virginia rail responded positively to forest cover. Only American bittern responded negatively to mean May-June temperature; only pied-billed grebe responded positively to start of growing season; and only Virginia rail had higher occupancy at inland marshes compared to coastal. We combined predictions from the best model for each of 5 species with reasonably good model fit (we excluded sora and Virginia rail) to identify priority habitat areas for marsh-breeding birds. Expansion of wetland conservation work from existing priority areas based on waterfowl to also include these new additional priority areas based on marsh-breeding birds will be an important step towards conservation of all birds, and will help slow or maybe even reverse declining population trends. Some restoration activities outside but adjacent to priority areas will also be important for rebuilding marshes for these species across this intensively farmed and developed region.

We used 11 years (2011-2021) of data collected by the Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program at 1,962 point-count locations in 792 wetlands to quantify the first-ever annual abundance indices and trends of 18 marsh-breeding bird species in coastal wetlands throughout the entire Great Lakes. Nine species (50%) increased by 8-37% per year across all of the Great Lakes combined, whereas none decreased. Twelve species (67%) increased by 5-50% per year in at least 1 of the 5 Great Lakes, whereas only 3 species (17%) decreased by 2-10% per year in at least 1 of the lakes. There were more positive trends among lakes and species (n = 34, 48%) than negative trends (n = 5, 7%). These large increases are welcomed because most of the species are of conservation concern in the Great Lakes. Trends were likely caused by long-term, cyclical fluctuations in Great Lakes water levels. Lake levels increased over most of the study, which inundated vegetation and increased open water-vegetation interspersion and open water extent, all of which are known to positively influence abundance of most of the increasing species and negatively influence abundance of all of the decreasing species. Coastal wetlands may be more important for marsh birds than once thought if they provide high-lake-level-induced population pulses for species of conservation concern. Coastal wetland protection and restoration are of utmost importance to safeguard this process. Future climate projections show increases in lake levels over the coming decades, which will cause coastal squeeze of many wetlands if they are unable to migrate landward fast enough to keep pace. If this happens, less habitat will be available to support periodic pulses in marsh bird abundance, which appear to be important for regional population dynamics. Actions that allow landward migration of coastal wetlands during increasing lake levels by removing or preventing barriers to movement, such as shoreline hardening, will be useful for maintaining marsh bird breeding habitat in the Great Lakes. center dot We calculated the first-ever abundance estimates for 18 marsh-breeding bird species over 11 years (2011-2021) in coastal wetlands throughout all of the North American Great Lakes.center dot Abundance of 9 (50%) species increased by large amounts, but none decreased, which is welcomed because the abundance of most species was already low.center dot Increases were likely caused by rising water levels, which created high-quality marsh bird habitat consisting of patches of wet, standing vegetation (such as cattails) interspersed with pools of open water.center dot Coastal wetlands may provide critical, periodic boosts to regional populations of marsh birds during rising water levels, but this may be threatened in the future because extremely high-water levels due to climate change could cause reductions in marsh bird habitat due to flooding.center dot Protection and restoration of coastal wetlands and actions that allow landward migration of coastal wetlands by removing or preventing barriers to movement will be needed. Les zones humides des Grands Lacs laurentiens d'Amerique du Nord (c.-a-d. les lacs Superieur, Michigan, Huron, erie et Ontario) constituent un habitat essentiel pour les oiseaux de marais. Nous avons utilise 11 ans (2011-2021) de donnees recueillies par le Programme de surveillance des zones humides cotieres des Grands Lacs a 1 962 points d'ecoute dans 792 zones humides pour quantifier les tout premiers indices annuels d'abondance et les tendances chez 18 especes d'oiseaux de marais dans les zones humides cotieres de l'ensemble des Grands Lacs. Neuf especes (50 %) ont augmente de 8 a 37 % par annee dans l'ensemble des Grands Lacs, tandis qu'aucune n'a diminue. Douze especes (67 %) ont augmente de 5 a 50 % par annee dans au moins un des cinq Grands Lacs, alors que seulement trois especes (17 %) ont diminue de 2 a 10 % par annee dans au moins un des lacs. Il y avait plus de tendances positives parmi les lacs et les especes (n = 34, 48 %) que de tendances negatives (n = 5, 7 %). Ces fortes augmentations sont les bienvenues car la plupart des especes sont preoccupantes sur le plan de la conservation dans les Grands Lacs. Les tendances ont probablement ete causees par des fluctuations cycliques a long terme des niveaux d'eau des Grands Lacs. Le niveau des lacs a augmente pendant la majeure partie de l'etude, ce qui a inonde la vegetation et augmente la juxtaposition de l'eau libre et de la vegetation, ainsi que l'etendue de l'eau libre, qui sont reconnus pour influencer positivement l'abondance de la plupart des especes en augmentation et d'influencer negativement l'abondance de toutes les especes en diminution. Les zones humides cotieres peuvent etre plus importantes pour les oiseaux de marais qu'on ne le pensait auparavant si elles fournissent des impulsions demographiques induites par le niveau eleve des lacs pour les especes dont la conservation est preoccupante. La protection et la restauration des zones humides cotieres sont d'une importance capitale pour preserver ce processus. Les projections climatiques futures indiquent une augmentation des niveaux d'eau au cours des prochaines decennies, ce qui entrainera une << compression cotiere >> de plusieurs zones humides si elles ne sont pas en mesure de migrer vers l'interieur des terres assez rapidement pour suivre le rythme. Dans ce cas, il y aura moins d'habitat disponible pour soutenir les pulsations periodiques de l'abondance des oiseaux de marais, qui semblent importantes pour la dynamique des populations regionales. Les mesures qui permettent la migration vers l'interieur des terres des zones humides cotieres lorsque le niveau des lacs augmente, en eliminant ou en empechant la formation d'obstacles au mouvement, comme le durcissement des rives, seront utiles pour maintenir l'habitat de reproduction des oiseaux de marais dans les Grands Lacs.","[Tozer, Douglas C.; Ethier, Danielle M.] Birds Canada, Long Point Waterfowl & Wetlands Res Program, Port Rowan, ON, Canada; [Bracey, Annie M.; Niemi, Gerald J.] Univ Minnesota Duluth, Nat Resources Res Inst, Duluth, MN USA; [Fiorino, Giuseppe E.; Grabas, Greg P.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gehring, Thomas M.; Wheelock, Bridget A.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Mt Pleasant, MI USA; [Gehring, Thomas M.; Wheelock, Bridget A.] Cent Michigan Univ, Inst Great Lakes Res, Mt Pleasant, MI USA; [Gnass Giese, Erin E.; Howe, Robert W.] Univ Wisconsin Green Bay, Cofrin Ctr Biodivers, Green Bay, WI USA; [Lawrence, Gregory J.] SUNY Coll Brockport, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol, Brockport, NY USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota Hospital; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Central Michigan University; Central Michigan University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Green Bay; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Brockport,"Tozer, DC (corresponding author), Birds Canada, Long Point Waterfowl & Wetlands Res Program, Port Rowan, ON, Canada.",dtozer@birdscanada.org,"Lawrence, Gregory/D-3926-2009","Tozer, Douglas/0000-0001-9516-876X","Long Point Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Program of Birds Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada [3000747437]; Wildlife Habitat Canada [23-300]; Great Lakes Restoration [GL-00E00612-0, 00E01567, 00E02956]; USEPA","Long Point Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Program of Birds Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada; Wildlife Habitat Canada; Great Lakes Restoration; USEPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency)","D.C.T. and D.M.E. were supported during this work by the Long Point Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Program of Birds Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada (contract number 3000747437), and Wildlife Habitat Canada (grant number 23-300).

To achieve better biodiversity outcomes and match local governance capacity, cumulative effects assessment frameworks that combine Indigenous and western knowledge to predict future development impacts on biodiversity are needed. 2. We developed a spatial future-focused model informed by inclusive elicitation and strategic foresight to assess the regional cumulative effects of development on ecosystem health across the land and sea. We collaborated with three First Nations on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, enabling Indigenous priorities, knowledge and values to drive the process, from the choice of priority ecosystem components (including salmon, herring, seabirds and bears), to identifying future development scenarios (based on forestry, energy/mining, tourism and salmon aquaculture sectors). Bayesian networks were populated with empirical data and expert judgement elicited from knowledge holders to predict the cumulative effects of current and future pressures on species and ecosystems. 3. Under current conditions, the lowest probability of persistence was predicted for Pacific salmon (37%), followed by Pacific herring (43%). Under future conditions, the greatest declines in species health were associated with the intense development of mining, tourism and forestry, with up to a 54% decline from the current baseline health estimates predicted for Marbled Murrelets and old-growth forest. 4. Future outcomes for overall ecosystem health were predicted to be worst in scenarios with high future forestry activities (>60% decline in some areas). The continuation or development of all four industries resulted in an 8% decline overall in ecosystem health across the Central Coast. In contrast, predicted ecosystem health in the tourism economy scenario increased up to 15% in some marine areas, primarily driven by the removal of salmon aquaculture and forestry activities. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates an inclusive, regional approach to assessing the cumulative effects of future development on coastal species. The novel participatory tools and predictive framework draw upon and interweave multiple forms of knowledge, enabling Indigenous values to drive the process, and appropriately integrate Indigenous knowledge into regional cumulative effects assessment. Our interactive web application provides First Nations partners access to all outputs, supporting Indigenous-led governance and in situ ecosystem-based management of their lands and water.","[Tulloch, Vivitskaia J.

It is therefore urgent to identify major sites used during their annual cycle to achieve effective conservation measures. Our objective was to expand some aspects of the knowledge base needed to assess the ecological value of the St. Lawrence River Estuary for shorebird conservation. Here, we present the results of the most intensive shorebird survey ever conducted in the St. Lawrence River Estuary during fall migration. Surveys were conducted between St-Jean-Port-Joli and St-Simon-sur-Mer, Quebec, Canada, in 2011 and 2012, from late June/early July through late November, corresponding to the migration period of all species potentially present in the study area. The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) was one of the two most abundant species during both years of our study (most abundant species, followed by Dunlin [Calidris alpina] and Black-bellied Plover [Pluvialis squatarola] in 2011; second to Blackbellied Plover in 2012). Considering the entire shorebird community, abundance of individuals peaked in early September. Peak abundance occurred earlier for adults than for juveniles. For most species, juveniles largely outnumbered adults. Juveniles were relatively less abundant in 2012 than in 2011. This reflected a general trend observed in northeastern North America between those years, suggesting a lower breeding success in 2012. Given its importance as a staging site for juvenile birds (study area used annually by up to a few hundred thousand shorebirds) and therein, its conservation value, we recommend that the St. Lawrence River Estuary should be included within the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network.","[Turcotte, Yves] Coll La Pocatiere, Dept Sci & Tech Biol, 140 4e Ave, La Pocatiere, PQ G0R 1Z0, Canada; [Lamarre, Jean-Francois; Bety, Joel] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Biol, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Lamarre, Jean-Francois; Bety, Joel] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Etud Nord, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Lamarre, Jean-Francois] Polar Knowledge Canada, Canadian High Arctic Res Stn, Cambridge Bay, NU X0B 0C0, Canada",University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski,"Turcotte, Y (corresponding author), Coll La Pocatiere, Dept Sci & Tech Biol, 140 4e Ave, La Pocatiere, PQ G0R 1Z0, Canada.",yturcotte@cegeplapocatiere.qc.ca,NA,NA,Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies (FRQ-nT); Environnement et Changement climatique Canada [K2C55-12-2053]; Comite Z.i.P. du Sudde-l'Estuaire; Cegep de La Pocatiere; Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies; Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et en genie du Canada (CRSnG/nSERC); universite du Quebec a Rimouski,Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies (FRQ-nT)(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies (FRQNT)); Environnement et Changement climatique Canada; Comite Z.i.P. du Sudde-l'Estuaire; Cegep de La Pocatiere; Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies (FRQNT)); Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et en genie du Canada (CRSnG/nSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); universite du Quebec a Rimouski,"We are grateful to J.-E.

The abundance of US and Canadian resident species decreased by 30 percent, and that of migrants within the United States and Canada decreased by 19 percent. By contrast, Neotropical migrants increased by up to 20 percent. Land-cover changes in northern latitudes therefore seem more consequential for bird populations than those occurring in Neotropical habitats. Lower abundances were most marked for resident breeding birds that used open, edge, and wetland habitats, the environments most affected by human disturbances-particularly urban sprawl-in northern latitudes. The abundance of resident and migrant forest-dwelling birds increased (although trends varied from species to species), with the increases seeming to follow the 20th-century expansion of forest area in northern latitudes, rather than the loss of Neotropical forests. The geographic footprint of changes in bird abundance linked to habitat changes in North America may thus be extending southward, with negative effects on birds that use open habitats and positive effects on forest birds.","Boston Univ, Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",Boston University; Marine Biological Laboratory - Woods Hole,"Valiela, I (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",valiela@bu.edu; pmartin@mdp.edu.ar,NA,"Martinetto, Paulina/0000-0002-9845-5817",NA,NA,NA,NA,41,45,67,1,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0006-3568,1525-3244,NA,BIOSCIENCE,Bioscience,APR,57,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,360,370,NA,10.1641/B570410,http://dx.doi.org/10.1641/B570410,NA,NA,11,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,153FT,NA,"Green Published, Bronze",NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000245418200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, little BBS coverage is available in the boreal forest, where increasing concern over the status of species breeding there has increased interest in northward expansion of the BBS. However, high disturbance rates in the boreal forest may complicate roadside monitoring. If the roadside sampling frame does not capture variation in disturbance rates because of either road placement or the use of roads for resource extraction, biased trend estimates might result. In this study, we examined roadside bias in the proportional representation of habitat disturbance via spatial data on forest loss, forest fires, and anthropogenic disturbance. In each of 455 BBS routes, the area disturbed within multiple buffers away from the road was calculated and compared against the area disturbed in degree blocks and BBS strata. We found a nonlinear relationship between bias and distance from the road, suggesting forest loss and forest fires were underrepresented below 75 and 100 m, respectively. In contrast, anthropogenic disturbance was overrepresented at distances below 500 m and underrepresented thereafter. After accounting for distance from road, BBS routes were reasonably representative of the degree blocks they were within, with only a few strata showing biased representation. In general, anthropogenic disturbance is overrepresented in southern strata, and forest fires are underrepresented in almost all strata. Similar biases exist when comparing the entire road network and the subset sampled by BBS routes against the amount of disturbance within BBS strata; however, the magnitude of biases differed. Based on our results, we recommend that spatial stratification and rotating panel designs be used to spread limited BBS and off-road sampling effort in an unbiased fashion and that new BBS routes be established where sufficient road coverage exists.","[Van Wilgenburg, Steven L.; Beck, Elizabeth M.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Obermayer, Brennan; Joyce, Timothy; Weddle, Brett] Sir Sanford Fleming Coll, Cobourg, ON, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Van Wilgenburg, SL (corresponding author), 115 Perimeter Rd, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X4, Canada.",Steve.Vanwilgenburg@Canada.ca,"Van Wilgenburg, Steven/LGZ-9979-2024","Van Wilgenburg, Steven/0000-0002-6742-4567",NA,NA,NA,NA,53,14,16,0,16,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1712-6568,NA,NA,AVIAN CONSERV ECOL,Avian Conserv.

Monitoring data to track changes in boreal forest bird populations are scarce. Therefore, we repeated surveys at historic research sites in aspen-dominated boreal mixedwood forest in central Saskatchewan, Canada, to test for changes in abundance in different forest age classes. We used GIS analyses and habitat data to test whether observed changes in abundance were correlated with within-stand changes in habitat over approximately 20 years. Eight of the ten species examined showed evidence for change in abundance. Trends from our study showed little correlation with regional trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and generally displayed greater magnitude and precision. Species associated with closedcanopy forests declined more rapidly than suggested by BBS surveys, whereas species associated with disturbance generally had opposite trends to the BBS. Decreased abundance of species such as Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) and Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata) correlated with loss of forest cover from fire or harvesting. Conversely, changes in the abundance of species associated with early successional forest and canopy gaps were primarily correlated with within-stand disturbances (e.g., Magnolia Warbler [Setophaga magnolia]) and changes in the proportion of the stands composed of conifers (e.g., White-throated Sparrow [.Zonotrichia albicollis]). We suggest repeating historic surveys and comparing trends with other monitoring programs to provide a weight-of-evidence approach to assess overall support for changes in species' status for regions where data are sparse. Our results are consistent with previous studies that predict that changes in the forest age-class distribution could alter boreal forest bird abundance and community composition. Long-term conservation plans should integrate projected land-use and climate effects on boreal forest bird populations.","[Van Wilgenburg, Steven L.; Beck, Elizabeth M.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Hobson, Keith A.; Kardynal, Kevin J.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Van Wilgenburg, SL (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, 115 Perimeter Rd, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X4, Canada.",Steven.vanwilgenburg@Canada.ca,"Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019; Van Wilgenburg, Steven/LGZ-9979-2024","Van Wilgenburg, Steven/0000-0002-6742-4567",Environment Canada; Prince Albert Model Forest (Project 211); federal-Saskatchewan Partnership Agreement in Forestry [CS5006],Environment Canada(CGIAR); Prince Albert Model Forest (Project 211); federal-Saskatchewan Partnership Agreement in Forestry,"We thank Parks Canada Agency and its staff (S.

Location modelling was conducted over the entire province of Ontario, Canada, an area of approximate to 900,000 km(2) Methods Data on the distribution of breeding in the province was derived from the Breeding Bird Atlas of Ontario. We used logistic regression to model the relationship between the probability of breeding (assessed in 10 km x 10 km blocks) and estimates of a variety of climate variables at the same scale. Models were selected that had the least number of explanatory variables while at the same time having close to the best possible classification accuracy. Results The final models for these five species had from one to six explanatory variables and an overall concordance of 70.4% to 86.3% indicating a good classification accuracy. Results from subsampling 50% of the original data ten times indicate that (1) the classification accuracy of the model for data used to generate the model is not very sensitive to the specific observations used to generate the model (2) the classification accuracy of lest data is close to the classification accuracy of the model data and (3) the classification accuracy of the test data is not dependent on the specific observations used to generate the model. We generated a spatial prediction of the probability of occurrence of each species for Ontario using the relationships defined by the logistic regression models and using 1 km gridded estimates of the necessary climate variables. These probability maps closely matched the maps of observed evidence of breeding from the Atlas. Main conclusions Although mechanisms controlling breeding distribution cannot be determined using this method, we can conclude that (1) macro-climate is an important factor directly and/or indirectly determining distribution of breeding in these species and (2) spatial predictions of probability of breeding are accurate enough to be useful in predicting probability of breeding in unsampled areas.","Canadian Forest Serv, Great Lakes Forestry Ctr, Landscape Anal & Applicat Sect, Sault St Marie, ON P6A 5M7, Canada; Canadian Forest Serv, No Forestry Ctr, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada",Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Venier, LA (corresponding author), Canadian Forest Serv, Great Lakes Forestry Ctr, Landscape Anal & Applicat Sect, 1219 Queen St E, Sault St Marie, ON P6A 5M7, Canada.",NA,"Venier, Lisa/GYU-3566-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41,38,52,0,9,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,NA,NA,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Our objective was to examine the ability of regional climate, AVHRR (1 km resolution) land cover and MSS (200 m resolution) land cover to predict the distribution of breeding forest birds at the scale of the Great Lakes Basin and at the resolution of Breeding Bird Atlas data (5-10 km(2)). Specifically we addressed the following questions. (1) How well do AVHRR or MSS classifications capture the variation in distribution of bird species? (2) Is one land cover classification more useful than the other for predicting distribution? (3) How do models based on climate compare with models based on land cover? (4) Can the combination of both climate and land cover improve the predictive ability of these models. Location Modelling was conducted over the area of the Great Lakes Basin including parts of Ontario, Canada and parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania Wisconsin, and Minnesota, USA. Methods We conducted single variable logistic regression with the forest classes of AVHRR and MSS land cover using evidence of breeding as the response variable. We conducted multiple logistic regression with stepwise selection to select models from five sets of explanatory variables (AVHRR, MSS, climate, AVHRR + climate, MSS + climate). Results Generally, species were related to both AVHRR and MSS land cover types in the direction expected based on the known local habitat use of the species. Neither land cover classification appeared to produce consistently more intuitive results. Good models were generated using each of the explanatory data sets examined here. And at least one but usually all five variable sets produced acceptable or excellent models for each species. Main conclusions Both climate and large scale land cover were effective predictors of the distribution of the 10 forest bird species examined here. Models generated from these data had good classification accuracy of independent validation data. Good models were produced from all explanatory data sets or combinations suggesting that the distribution of climate, AVHRR land cover, and MSS land cover all captured similar variance in the distribution of the birds. It is difficult to separate the effects of climate and vegetation on the species' distributions at this scale.","Canadian Forest Serv, Landscape Anal & Applicat Sect, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada; Nat Resources Res Inst, Duluth, MN USA",Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Venier, LA (corresponding author), Canadian Forest Serv, Landscape Anal & Applicat Sect, 1219 Queen St E, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada.",lvenier@nrcan.gc.ca,"Venier, Lisa/GYU-3566-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,92,70,83,0,29,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,NA,NA,J BIOGEOGR,J.

We demonstrate that the relationship does not hold when a longer-term data set (19682008) is used for the analysis. Sleep et al. (2009) also demonstrated a positive relationship between correlations of Canada warbler abundance and time and spruce budworm defoliation and time using provincial data sets. We examined the underlying BBS data and found that there were insufficient observations of Canada warbler in the western provinces (Alberta and Manitoba) to support the conclusion because most Canada warbler observations occurred far (>100?km) from any budworm defoliation. As well, we used a density-dependent stochastic population growth model as proposed by Sleep et al. (2009) and found only 2 significant relationships (Nova Scotia, Alberta) between Canada warbler population growth rate and budworm defoliation at the provincial scale. We conclude that little analytical evidence exists to support the idea that Canada warbler decline is a function of spruce budworm decline.

Robust statistical modeling techniques are necessary to account for multiple sources of bias inherent to the data. One such citizen science project, eBird, is an online database of avian checklist data entered by birdwatchers from discrete locations and visits. The eBird dataset may be large enough to fill information gaps left by other monitoring programs if biases in the data are modeled appropriately and if the models can be validated against reliable survey data. We compared eBird and North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data from southern Ontario to determine if patterns in annual indices and long-term trends were similar for 22 species that reach the northern limit of their range in that region. Mixed-effects models were used to address varying observer skill and uneven geographic coverage in eBird, and the number of species per checklist was used as a covariate to represent effort and to accommodate historic lists lacking effort information.

Robust statistical modeling techniques are necessary to account for multiple sources of bias inherent to the data. One such citizen science project, eBird, is an online database of avian checklist data entered by birdwatchers from discrete locations and visits. The eBird dataset may be large enough to fill information gaps left by other monitoring programs if biases in the data are modeled appropriately and if the models can be validated against reliable survey data. We compared eBird and North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data from southern Ontario to determine if patterns in annual indices and long-term trends were similar for 22 species that reach the northern limit of their range in that region. Mixed-effects models were used to address varying observer skill and uneven geographic coverage in eBird, and the number of species per checklist was used as a covariate to represent effort and to accommodate historic lists lacking effort information. The average Pearson's correlation coefficient between eBird and BBS annual indices across species was 0.35, and the correlation between trends estimated from the annual indices was 0.72. eBird data generally agreed with BBS data with the exception of two common species that showed opposite trends, several species with low detection rates, and for two species with little long-term change in occurrence based on BBS data.

Additionally, current estimates of population trajectories of boreal and Arctic breeding species are imprecise or biased because of lack of coverage by Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes in that region.

Bayesian regression models of eBird data were used to estimate population trajectories of 22 boreal or Arctic breeding species of songbirds, 4 migratory songbird species that breed in eastern North America, and 2 species of raptors whose populations crashed due to the pesticide DDT. Models used range-wide data from the U.S. and Canada for spring migration/breeding, fall migration, and winter. To evaluate the model results, comparisons were made between eBird models from different seasons, between eBird indices and area defoliated by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), and between eBird, BBS, and Christmas Bird Count (CBC) annual indices and trends. Population trajectories were positively correlated between seasons for most of the species analyzed based on correlations between annual indices, magnitude of trends, and residuals from trend models.

The Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri) is a migratory oscine songbird with 2 recently diverged subspecies. The nominate subspecies (S. b. breweri) primarily breeds in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) shrublands in the western United States and southwestern Canada, whereas the Timberline Sparrow (S. b. taverneri) breeds in alpine shrubs and conifer krummholz near treeline in mountain ranges from east-central Alaska to northwestern Montana. Quantitative comparison of the acoustic structure of Brewer's Sparrow mate-attraction songs is needed to help resolve the outstanding debate regarding the taxonomic status of S. b. taverneri and improve subspecific identification from song recordings. I compared the acoustic structure of 181 short song types from 180 male S. b. breweri and 22 short song types from 20 male S. b. taverneri recorded from across each subspecies' breeding range. Despite extreme variation in acoustic structure of short songs among individuals, 19 acoustic variables differed between subspecies. Short song types of S. b. taverneri averaged 19.3%-22.1% lower maximum frequency, 4.9%-15.9% higher minimum frequency, 36.7%-42.6% narrower frequency bandwidth, and 12.9%-26.0% lower aggregate entropy (a measure of sound complexity) than those of S. b. breweri across acoustic elements (song, section, syllable, and note). Random forest classification analysis identified 10 acoustic variables important for distinguishing between short songs of the 2 subspecies and correctly classified 89.2% (95% CI 84.1% to 93.1%) of songs overall. Principal component scores representing overall acoustic structure showed an abrupt change near the breeding boundary between S. b. breweri and S. b. taverneri but overlapped sufficiently that they did not meet an established 75%-99% rule for reciprocal diagnosability of subspecies. An easy-to-measure logistic regression threshold based on song bandwidth and mean note bandwidth accurately classified >90% of short songs to subspecies. Additional recordings of S. b. taverneri are needed to improve our understanding of geographic variation in the song of that subspecies.

Ward 2000,Brown-Headed Cowbird parasitism results in a sink population in Warbling Vireos,2000,1.69,1,BBS,BBS,none,none,0,J,"Ward, D; Smith, JNM",NA,NA,NA,"Ward, D; Smith, JNM",NA,NA,AUK,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,BROOD PARASITISM; NESTING SUCCESS; PASSERINE; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; BIRDS,"The Warbling Vireo (Vireo gilvus) is one of the most heavily parasitized host species of the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), suffering up to 80% parasitism in some areas. Warbling Vireo nests that are parasitized by cowbirds typically produce no vireo young. To make predictions about the consequences of brood parasitism on local host populations, we investigated factors Chat allow such high parasitism to occur. The major factors leading to high levels of brood parasitism on Warbling Vireos in the Okanagan Valley British Columbia, are habitat overlap with cowbirds and the lack of response of vireos to cowbird eggs. Warbling Vireos responded more strongly to a cowbird dummy placed near the nest than to a dummy of a neutral species (junco) or to a common nest predator (crow). Preliminary simulation models based on population parameters obtained from three summers of fieldwork suggest that Warbling Vireos are in danger of extirpation from the Okanagan Valley if little movement of birds occurs between areas with different levers of brood parasitism. The models also indicate the sensitivity of this species to variation in adult and juvenile survival rates and number of successful broods produced per season. Our results emphasize the need for a metapopulation analysis that compares the population ecology of Warbling Vireos at high elevations land probably with low parasitism) with that at low elevations thigh parasitism) and that ascertains whether sufficient dispersal occurs between these populations to prevent extinction at lower elevations. Sufficient dispersal is indicated by apparently stable vireo populations in the Okanagan Valley and by Breeding Bird Survey data that show an overall increasing trend for this species in British Columbia.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Ctr Biodivers Res, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",ward@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"Ward, David/E-9814-2010","Ward, David/0000-0002-2705-408X",NA,NA,NA,NA,28,30,33,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0004-8038,1938-4254,NA,AUK,AUK,APR,117,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,337,344,NA,10.1642/0004-8038(2000)117[0337:BHCPRI]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2000)117[0337:BHCPRI]2.0.CO;2,NA,NA,8,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,306XJ,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000086623700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examine local environmental factors (visibility, moon phase) that may influence light attraction in Atlantic Puffins and explore the use of weight data and other information collected through this volunteer-based initiative to help monitor the health of this important population. In 2011, only 13 live Atlantic Puffins were captured despite nightly search efforts throughout the fledging period; this low capture rate was attributed to poor breeding success at the colony. In contrast, in 2012, 414 live fledgling puffins were captured and successfully released between 6 August and 5 September; 388 of these were banded and weighed prior to release. Capture rates on nights with poor visibility due to fog (26 fledglings per night) were similar to fogless nights (24 fledglings per night). Most live Atlantic Puffins were captured within a two-week period around the new moon. Fledglings weighed 248 +/- 25 (SD) g, range = 160-315 g; weights significantly declined over the fledging period. In addition to the direct conservation benefits of saving grounded Atlantic Puffins, information collected through this volunteer-based initiative 1) provides insight on factors affecting Atlantic Puffins' attraction to coastal communities, 2) shows the importance of mitigating artificial light during the birds' fledging period within these developing communities, and 3) helps collect important demographic information without causing additional disturbance to the colonies.","[Wilhelm, Sabina I.] Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Mt Pearl, NF A1N 4T3, Canada; [Schau, Juergen J.; Schau, Elfie] Puffin Patrol, Witless Bay, NF AOA 4KO, Canada; [Dooley, Suzanne M.] Canadian Pk & Wilderness Soc, St John, NF A1B 3T1, Canada; [Wiseman, Dena L.] Puffin Patrol, Witless Bay, NF A0A 4K0, Canada; [Hogan, Holly A.] Dept Environm & Conservat, Pk & Nat Areas Div, Witless Bay, NF A0A 4K0, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Wilhelm, SI (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, 6 Bruce St, Mt Pearl, NF A1N 4T3, Canada.",sabina.wilhelm@ec.gc.ca,NA,"Wilhelm, Sabina/0000-0002-7842-7317",Environment Canada's EcoAction Community Funding Program; Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society; Newfoundland and Labrador Chapter; Government of Newfoundland; Labrador's Department of Environment and Conservation (Parks and Natural Areas Division); Environment Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service,Environment Canada's EcoAction Community Funding Program; Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society; Newfoundland and Labrador Chapter; Government of Newfoundland; Labrador's Department of Environment and Conservation (Parks and Natural Areas Division); Environment Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service,"We wish to thank the numerous dedicated Puffin Patrol volunteers who roamed the streets nightly during the fledging period, and without whom this study would not have been possible.

Climate change is having a disproportionate impact on the Arctic. For Arctic breeding birds, basic knowledge of their annual cycle, specifically the timing, route, and movement behavior of migration, is needed to understand when and where populations may experience threats. We used a combination of geolocators and stable isotope analysis to identify route and timing of migration in Smith's Longspurs (Calcarius pictus) that breed in Alaska's Brooks Range. We trapped males on their breeding grounds from 2011 to 2014 and collected head feathers for stable isotopes of hydrogen (62H). We deployed 22 geolocators on a subset of individuals and retrieved four, which all overwintered in southern Texas. Individual start dates for fall migration based on geolocators were more variable than for the spring, and individuals were highly mobile while on their wintering grounds. Geolocators and stable isotope values were comparable across years and indicated that birds from the Brooks Range undergo their pre-nuptial molt in central Canada. We compared geolocator and stable isotope inferred locations to observations submitted to e-Bird and found that longspurs were distributed farther south during the winter months, but farther north during the spring than most eBird observations. Concurrent deployments of geolocator tags across Smith's Longspurs' breeding range would clarify whether migratory behaviors and routes are population-specific or shared widely across breeding locations.","[Will, Alexis] World Wildlife Fund, US Arctic Program, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Will, Alexis] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK USA; [McFarland, Heather] Univ Alaska, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Latty, Christopher] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Arctic Natl Wildlife Refuge, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Powell, Abby] US Geol Survey, Florida Fish & Wildlife Cooperat Res Unit, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; [Powell, Abby] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Conservat & Ecol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",World Wildlife Fund; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Powell, A (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Florida Fish & Wildlife Cooperat Res Unit, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA.;Powell, A (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Conservat & Ecol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",abbypowell@ufl.edu,NA,NA,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Science Support Program grant; USFWS Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; USGS Alaska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Bureau of Land Management; Arctic Audubon Grant; Ted McHenry Scholarship, Bergstrom Memorial Scholarship; John Marooney Scholarship; CASE GK -12 Fellowship; Japan's National Institute of Polar Research","U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Science Support Program grant; USFWS Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; USGS Alaska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Bureau of Land Management; Arctic Audubon Grant; Ted McHenry Scholarship, Bergstrom Memorial Scholarship; John Marooney Scholarship; CASE GK -12 Fellowship; Japan's National Institute of Polar Research","This study would not have been possible without the financial and logistical support of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Science Support Program grant; the USFWS Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; USGS Alaska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; and the Bureau of Land Management.

One of the most dramatic changes has been that of western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis) in the Salish Sea. This region was a former core of the species wintering distribution but they have become increasingly rare prompting calls for conservation action. A more thorough understanding of this situation requires the analysis of trends at broader geographic scales as well as a consideration of mechanisms that might have led to a change in abundance. We used hierarchical modeling with a Bayesian framework applied to 36 years of Audubon Christmas Bird Count data to assess continent-wide and regional population trends in western and Clark's grebes (A. clarkii) from 1975 to 2010. Our results show that the North American wintering population of Aechmophorus grebes decreased by similar to 52% after 1975, but also that western grebes displayed strongly opposing regional patterns. Abundance decreased by about 95% over 36 years in the Salish Sea but increased by over 300% along coastal California. As a result, the mean centre of the species distribution shifted south by an estimated 895 km between 1980 and 2010. Mechanisms underlying this shift require further study but we hypothesize that it may be related to a change in the abundance and availability of their forage fish prey base. Since the mid-1980s, the Pacific sardine stock off the California coast increased from a few thousand metric tonnes to over two million. At the same time both the abundance and availability of Pacific herring declined in the Salish Sea. Studies are needed to examine this hypothesis further and additional consideration should be directed at other changes in the marine environment that may have contributed to a range shift.","[Wilson, Scott] Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Anderson, Eric M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Wilson, Amy S.

However, different agricultural systems vary in their effects depending on their resemblance to the natural ecosystem, coverage across the landscape, and operational intensity. We combined data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey with remotely sensed measures of crop type and linear woody feature (LWF) density to study how agricultural type, woody structure and crop heterogeneity influenced the avian community at landscape scales across a broad agricultural region of eastern Canada Specifically, we examined whether 1) avian diversity and abundance differed between arable crop agriculture (e.g., corn, soy) and forage (e.g., hay) and pastoral agriculture, 2) whether increasing the density of LWF enhances avian diversity and abundance, and 3) whether increasing the heterogeneity of arable crop types can reduce negative effects of arable crop amount. Avian diversity was lower in landscapes dominated by arable crop compared to forage agriculture likely due to a stronger negative correlation between arable cropping and the amount of natural land cover. In contrast, total avian abundance did not decline with either agricultural type, suggesting that species tolerant to agriculture are compensating numerically for the loss of non-tolerant species. This indicates that bird diversity may be a more sensitive response than bird abundance to crop cover type in agricultural landscapes. Higher LWF densities had positive effects on the diversity of forest and shrub bird communities as predicted. Higher crop heterogeneity did not reduce the negative effects of high crop amount as expected except for wetland bird abundance. In contrast, greater crop heterogeneity actually strengthened the negative effects of high crop amount on forest bird abundance, shrub forest edge bird diversity and total bird diversity. We speculate that this was due to negative correlations between crop heterogeneity and the amount of shrub and forest habitat patches in crop-dominated landscapes in our study region. The variable response to crop heterogeneity across guilds suggests that policies aimed at crop diversification may not enhance avian diversity on their own and that management efforts aimed at the retention of natural forest and shrub patches, riparian corridors, and hedge-rows would be more directly beneficial.","[Wilson, Scott; Mitchell, Gregory W.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Wildlife Res Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Mitchell, Gregory W.; Pasher, Jon; McGovern, Mark] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Landscape Sci & Technol Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Hudson, Marie-Anne R.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Fahrig, Lenore] Carleton Univ, Geomat & Landscape Ecol Res Lab, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Carleton University,"Wilson, S (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Wildlife Res Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada.",scott.wilson@canada.ca,"Wilson, Scott/AAC-7144-2021; Fahrig, Lenore/C-6494-2012","Fahrig, Lenore/0000-0002-3841-0342",NA,NA,NA,NA,65,56,66,1,90,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,NA,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

In contrast, we observed declining recruitment in all regions, low apparent survival in the east and west, and a decline in apparent survival in the east. Abundance declined with increasing disturbance around MAPS stations. Between 1993 and 2009, the human footprint index on the breeding range increased by 0.11% in contrast to a 14% increase on the wintering range. Landscape-scale disturbance on the breeding grounds may influence abundance in some regions; however, the observed trends in demography and footprint suggests limitation during the non-breeding period as the likely driver of overall declines, particularly for eastern populations.","[Wilson, Scott] Environm Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Wildlife Res Div, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Saracco, James F.] Inst Bird Populat, POB 1346, Point Reyes Stn, CA 94956 USA; [Krikun, Richard; Flockhart, D.

Most research on the latter comes from studies on the influence of different agricultural types within a single ecosystem with far less study on how the natural ecosystem context shapes the response of biodiversity to agricultural production. We used citizen science data from agricultural areas in Canada's Eastern Hardwood-Boreal (forest ecosystem, n =108 landscapes) and Prairie Pothole (prairie ecosystem, n = 99) regions to examine how ecosystem context shapes the response of avian species diversity, functional diversity and abundance to the amount of arable crop and pastoral agriculture at landscape scales. Avian surveys were conducted along 8km transects of Breeding Bird Survey routes with land cover assembled within a 20km(2) landscape around each transect. The amount of agriculture at which species diversity peaked differed between the forest (15%) and prairie (51%) ecosystems, indicating that fewer species tolerated the expansion of agriculture in the former. In both ecosystems, functional diversity initially increased with agriculture and peaked at higher amounts (forest 42%, prairie: 77%) than species diversity suggesting that functional redundancy was lost first as agriculture increased. Species turnover with increasing agriculture was primarily among functional groups in forest where a shift from a low to a high agriculture landscape led to a decline in the percent of the community represented by Neotropical migrants, insectivores, upper foliage gleaners and bark foragers, and an increase in the percent of the community represented by short-distance migrants, granivores, omnivores and ground gleaners. There were few distinct shifts in the percent of the community represented by different functional groups in the prairie ecosystem. Total abundance was the least sensitive measure examined in both ecosystems and indicated that species losses with agriculture are likely followed by numerical compensation from agriculture tolerant species. Our results highlight the importance of ecosystem context for understanding how biodiversity is affected by agricultural production with declines in diversity occurring at lower agricultural extents in ecosystems with lower similarity between natural and agricultural land covers. These findings allow for more specific conservation recommendations including managing for species intolerant to agriculture in prairie ecosystems and limiting the expansion of high contrast agriculture and the loss of semi-natural habitat, such as hedge rows, in historically forested ecosystems.","[Wilson, Scott; Mitchell, Gregory W.] Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Wildlife Res Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Wilson, Scott; Mitchell, Gregory W.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Wilson, Scott] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Alavi, Niloofar; Pouliot, Darren] Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Landscape Sci & Technol Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Alavi, Niloofar] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Carleton University; University of British Columbia; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Carleton University,"Wilson, S (corresponding author), Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Wildlife Res Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",scott.wilson@canada.ca,"Wilson, Scott/AAC-7144-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,62,15,18,4,59,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,1873-2305,NA,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

However, it is often challenging to collect the necessary population and demographic data to understand population dynamics. Integrated population modeling (IPM) provides an opportunity to combine population survey and demographic data from different sources. We developed an IPM and applied it to jointly analyze 15 years (2004-2018) of regional North American Breeding Bird Survey and site-level capture-recapture and age-ratio data for a barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) population in Ontario, Canada. We aimed to identify key demographic parameters and tested hypothesized environmental drivers to understand population declines of this species. Our results showed that the study population had declined by about 2% annually during our study period, which was mainly contributed by changes in net immigration and adult apparent survival. In particular, low net immigration in a few years of our study period seemed to be the main reason of population decline. Furthermore, we found that warmer temperatures in April when barn swallows return to breeding grounds had a positive effect on adult survival, while warmer temperatures during the breeding period in May-June had a negative effect on productivity. Our results indicate vulnerability of the species to inclement weather during the breeding season, suggesting potential population recovery by adopting conservation strategies that buffer climatic threats. Moreover, our IPM provides a foundation for future monitoring programs that intend to combine and maximize the utility of large-scale population counts and fine-scale demographic data.","[Zhao, Qing; Weegman, Mitch D.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Mitchell, Greg W.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mitchell, Greg W.; Wilson, Scott] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Cadman, Michael D.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Kusack, Jackson W.; Hobson, Keith A.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Evans, Dean R.; Bumelis, Kaelyn] Birds Canada, Port Rowan, ON, Canada; [Hobson, Keith A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Wilson, Scott] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Carleton University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; University of British Columbia,"Zhao, Q (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",zhaoqin@umsystem.edu,"Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019",NA,"Environment and Climate Change Canada [3000701239, 3000719143]",Environment and Climate Change Canada,The research is funded by Environment and Climate Change Canada (contract number 3000701239 and 3000719143).,NA,83,6,6,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,NA,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Tick populations are establishing in new areas globally in response to climate change and other factors. New Brunswick is a Canadian maritime province at the advancing front of tick population establishment and has seen increasing numbers of ticks carrying B. burgdorferi, and more recently B. miyamotoi. Further, it is part of a region of Atlantic Canada with wildlife species composition differing from much of continental North America and little information exists as to the presence and frequency of infection of Borrelia spp. in wildlife in this region. We used a citizen science approach to collect a wide range of animals including migratory birds, medium-sized mammals, and small mammals. In total we tested 339 animals representing 20 species for the presence of B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi. We have developed new nested PCR primers and a protocol with excellent specificity for detecting both of these Borrelia species, both single and double infections, in tissues and organs of various wildlife species. The positive animals were primarily small non-migratory mammals, approximately twice as many were infected with B. burgdorferi than B. miyamotoi and one animal was found infected with both. In addition to established reservoir species, the jumping mouse (Napaeozapus insignis) was found frequently infected; this species had the highest infection prevalence for both B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi and has not previously been identified as an important carrier for either Borrelia species. Comprehensive testing of tissues found that all instances of B. burgdorferi infection were limited to one tissue within the host, whereas two of the five B. miyamotoi infections were diffuse and found in multiple systems. In the one coinfected specimen, two fetuses were also recovered and found infected with B. miyamotoi. This presumptive transplacental transmission suggests that vertical transmission in mammals is possible. This finding implies that B. miyamotoi could rapidly spread into wildlife populations, as well as having potential human health implications.","[Zinck, Christopher B.] Univ Saskatchew, Western Coll Vet Med, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Lloyd, Vett K.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; Mount Allison University,"Lloyd, VK (corresponding author), Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB, Canada.",vlloyd@mta.ca,NA,"Lloyd, Vett/0000-0003-1191-2585; Zinck, Christopher/0000-0002-9418-3009",Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN/4426-2015],Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This study was funded by a Venture grant from the Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation to CBZ (2018; https://canlyme.com) and a Discovery Grant (RGPIN/4426-2015) from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) to VKL.The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",NA,66,14,15,1,6,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,NA,NA,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,21-Jan,17,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,e0262229,10.1371/journal.pone.0262229,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262229,NA,NA,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,0Z4TQ,35061805,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,2025-03-19,WOS:000791072800115,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ecologists have long been interested in the role of climate in shaping species' ranges, and in recent years, this relationship has taken on greater significance because of the need for accurate predictions of the effects of climate change on wildlife populations. Bioclimatic relationships, however, are potentially complicated by various environmental factors operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we test the hypothesis that climatic constraints on bird distributions are modified by species-specific responses to weather, urbanization and use of supplemental food. 2. Our analyses focused on 18 bird species with data from over 3000 sites across the north-eastern United States and adjacent Canadian provinces. We use hierarchal occupancy modelling to quantify the effects of short-term weather variation and surrounding urbanization on food stress and probabilities of detection, and how these fine-scale changes modify the role that climate has on the distributions of wintering bird populations at regional scales. 3. Examining site occupancy and supplemental food use across the study region, we found that average minimum temperature was an important factor limiting bird distributions, supporting the hypothesis that the occupancy of wintering birds is limited by climatic constraints. We found that 15 of 18 species (83%) were more energetically stressed (had a higher likelihood of visiting a feeder station) as minimum temperature declined from the seasonal average. Because we found these patterns in populations that regularly visit supplemental food sites and were likely not food-limited, we suggest that resource availability is less important than climate in constraining wintering bird distributions. Across a winter season, local within-winter extinction probabilities were lower and colonization probabilities higher at warmer sites supporting the role of climate-mediated range shifts. Importantly, however, these relationships were modified by the degree of urbanization and species' abilities to persist in human-modified landscapes. 4. Our results suggest that urbanization and behavioural adaptation can modify the role of climate on bird ranges and should be included in future analyses of range shifts because of climate change.","[Zuckerberg, Benjamin; Bonter, David N.; Hochachka, Wesley M.; Koenig, Walter D.; Dickinson, Janis L.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [DeGaetano, Arthur T.] Cornell Univ, NE Reg Climate Ctr, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Zuckerberg, B (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",bz73@cornell.edu,"Zuckerberg, Benjamin/B-7907-2010; Koenig, Walter/A-5509-2009; Hochachka, Wesley/J-9768-2012; Bonter, David/H-1313-2013","Koenig, Walter/0000-0001-6207-1427; Hochachka, Wesley/0000-0002-0595-7827; Bonter, David/0000-0003-1768-1941",NA,NA,NA,NA,49,107,131,3,133,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,NA,J ANIM ECOL,J.
